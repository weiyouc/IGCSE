MARK SCHEME 

Maximum Mark: 80 

 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the 

examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the 

details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have 

considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for 

Teachers. 

Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the March 2017 series for most Cambridge IGCSE 

 ® , 

Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components.

###### MARK SCHEME NOTES 

 The following notes are intended to aid interpretation of mark schemes in general, but individual mark schemes 

 may include marks awarded for specific reasons outside the scope of these notes. 

 Types of mark 

 M Method marks, awarded for a valid method applied to the problem. 

 A Accuracy mark, awarded for a correct answer or intermediate step correctly obtained. For accuracy 

 marks to be given, the associated Method mark must be earned or implied. 

 B Mark for a correct result or statement independent of Method marks. 

 When a part of a question has two or more ‘method’ steps, the M marks are in principle independent unless the 

 scheme specifically says otherwise; and similarly where there are several B marks allocated. The notation ‘ dep ’ 

 is used to indicate that a particular M or B mark is dependent on an earlier mark in the scheme.
