### MARK SCHEME for the October/November 2015 series 

## 0606 ADDITIONAL MATHEMATICS 

#### 0606/11 Paper 1, maximum raw mark 80 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of 

the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not 

indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, 

which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner 

Report for Teachers. 

Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2015 series for most 

Cambridge IGCSE 

 ® , Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some 

Cambridge O Level components.
