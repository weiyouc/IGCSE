MARK SCHEME 

Maximum Mark: 80 

 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the 

examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the 

details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have 

considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for 

Teachers. 

Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2018 series for most 

Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and 

some Cambridge O Level components.

 Generic Marking Principles 

These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. 

They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors 

for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. 

##### GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: 

 Marks must be awarded in line with: 

  the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question 

  the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question 

  the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. 

##### GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: 

 Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). 

##### GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: 

 Marks must be awarded positively : 

  marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit 

 is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, 

 referring to your Team Leader as appropriate 

  marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do 

  marks are not deducted for errors 

  marks are not deducted for omissions 

  answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these 

 features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The 

 meaning, however, should be unambiguous. 

##### GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: 

 Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed 

 instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. 

##### GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: 

 Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question 

 (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate 

 responses seen). 

##### GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: 

 Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should 

 not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

##### MARK SCHEME NOTES 

The following notes are intended to aid interpretation of mark schemes in general, but individual mark schemes 

may include marks awarded for specific reasons outside the scope of these notes. 

**Types of mark** 

M Method marks, awarded for a valid method applied to the problem. 

A Accuracy mark, awarded for a correct answer or intermediate step correctly obtained. For accuracy 

 marks to be given, the associated Method mark must be earned or implied. 

B Mark for a correct result or statement independent of Method marks. 

When a part of a question has two or more ‘method’ steps, the M marks are in principle independent unless the 

scheme specifically says otherwise; and similarly where there are several B marks allocated. The notation ‘ **dep** ’ 

is used to indicate that a particular M or B mark is dependent on an earlier mark in the scheme. 

**Abbreviations** 

awrt answers which round to 

cao correct answer only 

dep dependent 

FT follow through after error 

isw ignore subsequent working 

nfww not from wrong working

rot rounded or truncated
