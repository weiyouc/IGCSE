 Instructions for preparing apparatus 

The Supervisor is **not** allowed to consult the Question Paper before the examination. This teacher should, as part of the preparation of the examination requirements, test the apparatus in order to ensure that it is satisfactory. 

The Supervisor is asked to give (and attach to the Supervisor’s Report printed on pages 7 and 8) a _brief_ description of the apparatus supplied, mentioning any points that are likely to be of importance to the Examiner in marking the answers. The Supervisor should also report any assistance given to candidates. All reports should be signed by the Supervisor. 

In addition to the usual equipment of a physics laboratory, each candidate will require the apparatus specified in these Confidential Instructions. If a candidate breaks any of the apparatus, or loses any of the material supplied, the matter should be rectified and a note made in the Supervisor’s Report. 

 Number of sets of apparatus 

As a _minimum_ , the number of sets of apparatus provided should be _N_ / 3, where _N_ is the number of candidates (per session). A few spare sets should, preferably, be available to avoid any candidate being delayed when moving to another question. 

The order in which a given candidate attempts the four questions is immaterial. It is suggested that candidates spend **about 20 minutes on each of questions 1 to 3 and about 15 minutes on question 4**. 

 Assistance to candidates 

The purpose of the Physics Practical Test is to find out whether the candidates can carry out simple practical work themselves. The Examiners are aware that candidates may sometimes be unable to show their practical ability through failure to understand some point in the theory of the experiment. If an Examiner were present in the laboratory, he/she would be willing to give a hint to enable such a candidate to get on with an experiment. In order to overcome this difficulty, the Supervisor is asked to cooperate with the Examiners to the extent of being ready to give (or allow the physics teacher to give) a hint to a candidate who is unable to proceed. 

The following regulations must be strictly adhered to. 

 (i) No hint may be announced to the candidates as a whole. 

 (ii) A candidate who is unable to proceed and requires assistance must come up to the Supervisor and state the difficulty. Candidates should be told that the Examiners will be informed of any assistance given in this way. 

**(iii)** A report must be made of any assistance given to the candidate, with the name and candidate number of the candidate. 

It is suggested that the following announcement be made to the candidates. 

‘The Examiners do not want you to waste time through inability to get on with an experiment. Any candidate, therefore, who is unable to get on with the experiment after spending five minutes at it may come to me and ask for help. I shall report to the Examiners any help given in this way, and some marks may be lost for the help given. You may ask me for additional apparatus which you think would improve the accuracy of your experiments, and you should say, on your script, how you use any such apparatus supplied.’

**Question 1** 

**Items to be supplied by the Centre (per set of apparatus unless otherwise specified)** 

 (i) Expendable spring, approximately 55 mm overall length (including loops) × 15 mm diameter, capable of supporting at least 500 g without overstretching (e.g. Philip Harris expendable steel spring, http://www.philipharris.co.uk ). See note 1. 

 (ii) Metre rule, graduated in mm. 

 (iii) A 300 g mass. See note 2. 

 (iv) 2 clamps, 2 bosses and a stand. See note 3. 

 (v) A pin mounted in a cork. See note 3. 

 (vi) Stopwatch. 

 (vii) Spare springs should be available. 

**Notes** 

**1.** When the spring is suspended from the clamp and is supporting the 300 g mass, it must be capable     of executing at least 10 oscillations when given a small vertical displacement. 

**2.** If slotted masses are available these can be used. Candidates should be provided with a mass of     300 g, including a mass hanger. 

**3.** The apparatus is to be set up as shown in Fig. 1.1.

**Action at changeover** 

Check that the apparatus is set up ready for the next candidate, as shown in Fig. 1.1. Replace the spring if it has been overstretched.

**Question 2** 

**Items to be supplied by the Centre (per set of apparatus unless otherwise specified)** 

 (i) Power supply of approximately 1.5 V–3 V. Where candidates are provided with a power supply with a variable output voltage, the voltage must be set by the Supervisor and fixed (e.g. taped). See note 2. 

 (ii) Switch. The switch may be an integral part of the power supply. 

 (iii) Ammeter capable of reading up to 1.00 A with a resolution of at least 0.05 A. See note 3. 

 (iv) Voltmeter capable of measuring the supply p.d. with a resolution of at least 0.1 V. See note 3. 

 (v) Approximately 105 cm of straight, bare constantan (Eureka) wire, diameter 0.45 mm (26 swg) or 0.38 mm (28 swg) or 0.32 mm (30 swg), taped to a metre rule only between the 3 cm and 7 cm marks and between the 93 cm and 97 cm marks. The end of the wire at the zero end of the rule is to be labelled P. See note 4. 

 (vi) Two suitable terminals (e.g. crocodile clips) attached to the constantan wire at the ends of the metre rule so that connections can be made to the circuit shown in Fig. 2.1. 

 (vii) Sliding contact, labelled C. This may be a jockey or a small screwdriver connected to a lead by means of a crocodile clip. 

 (viii) Sufficient connecting leads to set up the circuit shown in Fig. 2.1. 

**Notes** 

**1.** The circuit is to be set up for the candidates as shown in Fig. 2.1.

**2.** If cells are to be used, they must remain adequately charged throughout the examination. Spare     cells should be available. 

**3.** Either analogue or digital meters are suitable. Any variable settings should be set by the Supervisor     and fixed (e.g. taped). Spare meters should be available.
