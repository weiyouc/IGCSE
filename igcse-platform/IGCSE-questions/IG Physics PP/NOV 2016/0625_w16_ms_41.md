Inare method marks upon which further marks depend. For an M mark to be scored, the pointto which it refersparticular M mark, then none of the dependent marks can be scored.are independent marks, which do not depend on other marks. For a B mark to scored, thepoint to which it refers must be seen specifically in the candidate’s answers.In general A marks are awarded for final answers to numerical questions. If a final numerical answer, eligible for A marks, is correct, with the correct unit and anacceptable number of significant figures, all the marks for that question are normallyawarded. **must** be seen in a candidate's answer. If a candidate fails to score a C marksbrackets ( ) these rare circumstances, do not award the A marks, but award C marks on their merits.However, correct numerical answers with no working shown gain all the marks available.are compensatory marks in general applicable to numerical questions. These can be scoredeven if the point to which they refer are not written down by the candidate, **subsequent working gives evidence that they must have known it.** equation carries a C mark and the candidate does not write down the actual equation butdoes correct substitution or working which shows he knew the equation, then the C mark isscoredA C marks is not awarded if a candidate makes two points which contradict each other.Points which are wrong but irrelevant are ignored.around words or units in the mark scheme are intended to indicate wording used to clarifythe mark scheme, but the marks do not depend on seeing the words or units in brackets, e.g. 10 (J) means that the mark is scored for 10, regardless of the unit given. For example, if an **provided** underliningOR / ore.e.o.o.o.w.t.t.e.SpellingNot/NOT (^) Be generous about spelling and use of English. If an answer can be understood to meanwhat we want, give credit.

Thisprevents a candidate being penalised more than once for a particular mistake, but applies to marks annotated ecf. **only**
