 Instructions for preparing apparatus 

The Supervisor is **not** allowed to consult the Question Paper before the examination. This teacher should, as part of the preparation of the examination requirements, test the apparatus in order to ensure that it is satisfactory. 

The Supervisor is asked to give (and attach to the Report form printed on pages 7 and 8) a _brief_ description of the apparatus supplied, mentioning any points that are likely to be of importance to the Examiner in marking the answers. The Supervisor should also report any assistance given to candidates. All reports should be signed by the Supervisor and by the person responsible for preparing the apparatus. 

In addition to the usual equipment of a physics laboratory, each candidate will require the apparatus specified in these Instructions. If a candidate breaks any of the apparatus, or loses any of the material supplied, the matter should be rectified and a note made in the Report. 

 Number of sets of apparatus 

As a _minimum_ , the number of sets of apparatus provided should be _N_ / 3, where _N_ is the number of candidates (per session). A few spare sets should, preferably, be available to avoid any candidate being delayed when moving to another question. 

The order in which a given candidate attempts the four questions is immaterial. It is suggested that candidates spend **about 20 minutes on each of questions 1 to 3, followed by 15 minutes on question 4**. 

 Assistance to Candidates 

The purpose of the Practical Physics test is to find out whether the candidates can carry out simple practical work themselves. The Examiners are aware that candidates may sometimes be unable to show their practical ability through failure to understand some point in the theory of the experiment. If an Examiner were present in the laboratory, he/she would be willing to give a hint to enable such a candidate to get on with an experiment. In order to overcome this difficulty, the Supervisor is asked to co-operate with the Examiners to the extent of being ready to give (or allow the Physics teacher to give) a hint to a candidate who is unable to proceed. 

The following regulations must be strictly adhered to. 

 (i) No hint may be announced to the candidates as a whole. 

 (ii) A candidate who is unable to proceed and requires assistance must come up to the Supervisor and state the difficulty. Candidates should be told that the Examiners will be informed of any assistance given in this way. 

 (iii) A report must be made of any assistance given to the candidate, with the name and candidate number of the candidate. 

It is suggested that the following announcement be made to the candidates. 

‘The Examiners do not want you to waste time through inability to get on with an experiment. Any candidate, therefore, who is unable to get on with the experiment after spending five minutes at it may come to me and ask for help. I shall report to the Examiners any help given in this way, and some marks may be lost for the help given. You may ask me for additional apparatus which you think would improve the accuracy of your experiments, and you should say, on your script, how you use any such apparatus supplied.’

**Question 1** 

**Items to be supplied by the Centre (per set of apparatus unless otherwise specified)** 

 (i) Boiling tube (approximate capacity between 50 and 70 cm 3 ). 

 (ii) 2 rectangular wooden blocks. See note 1. 

 (iii) 100 cm^3 or 250 cm^3 measuring cylinder. 

 (iv) Top pan balance with a resolution of at least 1 g. This item may be shared but enough should be available so that candidates have easy, individual access. 

 (v) 50 cm or 30 cm ruler, graduated in mm. Candidates may use their own. 

 (vi) Supply of water. Each candidate will require about 100 cm 3. The temperature of the water is not important. 

 (vii) Supply of paper towels to mop up any spillages of water. 

**Notes** 

**1.** Each block should be approximately 10 cm long. The width and thickness must be greater than the     diameter of the boiling tube. 

**2.** Spare boiling tubes should be available. 

**Action at changeover** 

Check that the apparatus is ready for the next candidate.

**Question 2** 

**Items to be supplied by the Centre (per set of apparatus unless otherwise specified)** 

 (i) A bare resistance wire about 105 cm in length. 32 swg (0.274 mm diameter) constantan (Eureka), or any other wire with a resistance of approximately 8 Ω m –1, is suitable. See note 1. 

 (ii) Resistor, approximately 5 Ω, 2 W. The value must be hidden, e.g. taped over. 

 (iii) Metre rule or wooden strip. See note 1. 

 (iv) Power supply of approximately 3 V. See note 3. Where candidates are provided with a variable power supply, the voltage should be set by the Supervisor and fixed, e.g. taped. 

 (v) Switch. The switch may be an integral part of the power supply. 

 (vi) Sufficient connecting leads to set up the circuit shown in Fig. 2.1. 

 (vii) Crocodile clip. 

 (viii) Ammeter capable of measuring currents up to 1.00 A with a minimum resolution of 0.05 A. See note 4. 

 (ix) Voltmeter capable of measuring up to 3.0 V with a minimum resolution of 0.1 V. See note 4. 

**Notes** 

**1.** The resistance wire is to be fixed to the metre rule or wooden strip in such a way as to allow     candidates to connect a crocodile clip to points between 10 cm and 90 cm from the left-hand end     of the wire. 

**2.** The circuit is to be set up for candidates as shown in Fig. 2.1, with the crocodile clip connected to     the resistance wire. The position of the crocodile clip is not important.

**3.** When the crocodile clip is connected to the maximum length of the resistance wire, the reading     on the voltmeter should be at least 2.2 V. If cells are used, they must remain adequately charged     throughout the examination. Spare cells must be available. 

**4.** Either analogue or digital meters are suitable. Any variable settings should be set by the Supervisor     and fixed, e.g. taped. 

**5.** Spare resistors, leads, crocodile clips and meters should be available. 

**Action at changeover** 

Ensure that the circuit is connected as shown in Fig. 2.1 and check that the circuit is working. Switch the circuit off.
