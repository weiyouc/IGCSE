MARK SCHEME 

Maximum Mark: 40 

 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the 

examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the 

details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have 

considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for 

Teachers. 

Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2018 series for most 

Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and 

some Cambridge O Level components.

 Generic Marking Principles 

 These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside thespecific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with thesemarking principles.GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1:Marks must be awarded in line with:^ • 

 the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question 

## • 

 the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question 

## • 

 the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. 

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2:Marks awarded are always 

 whole marks 

 (not half marks, or other fractions). 

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3:Marks must be awarded 

 positively 

## : 

## • 

 marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond thescope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate 

## • 

 marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do 

## • 

 marks are not deducted for errors 

## • 

 marks are not deducted for omissions 

## • 

 answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by thequestion as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. 

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4:Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic leveldescriptors.

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5:Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range maybe limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6:Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds orgrade descriptors in mind.

 Question 

 Answer 

 Marks 

## 4 

 Method to include:(Hot) water in copper can, time taken for temperature to drop 

## 1 

 Correct use of at least 3 larger outer containers, separately 

## 1 

 Some indication that size of air gap is measured 

## 1 

 Any 

 two 

 from: Use of something to cover air gapUse of lid on copper canSame starting temperatureSame room temperatureSame volume of hot waterUse of ‘control’ with no outer containerInner container standing on an insulatorUniform air gap all round 

## 2 

 Table with clear columns for temperature and/or time (to match method) and air-gap, with appropriate units 

## 1 

 Conclusion: Least temperature drop 

## OR 

 longest time for temperature to drop shows lowest cooling rate 

## OR 

 best insulation 

## OR 

 plot temperature against time and least gradient shows lowest cooling rate (ora)
