**1** In this experiment, you will investigate the link between the brightness of a filament lamp and its resistance. The circuit has been set up for you. Carry out the following instructions, referring to Fig. 1.1. 

## A 

 power supply 2 V – 3 V 

 0.0 cm mark 

 metre rule resistance wire 

 crocodile clip 

 l 

 Fig. 1.1 (a) (i) On Fig. 1.1, use standard symbols to show a voltmeter connected to measure the potential difference across the lamp. [1] (ii) Connect the voltmeter in this position. (b) (i) Connect the crocodile clip to a length l of the resistance wire, where l = 100 cm. (ii) Switch on. In Table 1.1, record the potential difference V and the current I for the lamp. Switch off.

 (c) Calculate, and record in the table, the resistance R of the lamp for each value of l , using the equation R = V I. [2] (d) From your results and your observations of the lamp filament, state the link, if any, between the brightness of the lamp and its resistance. Explain clearly how your results support your statement. statement .................................................................................................................................. explanation ............................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... [2] (e) A student wishes to see if another lamp shows the same link between brightness and resistance. However, his lamp only glows dimly when a potential difference of 3 V is applied across it. The student decides that a method using a resistance wire is not suitable. Suggest an alternative circuit and apparatus which would allow him to vary the brightness of his lamp and to measure the potential difference and current for his lamp. You may draw a circuit diagram.

**3** In this experiment, you will determine the mass of a metre rule by a balancing method. Carry out the following instructions, referring to Fig. 3.1. metre rule mass^ _M_ 

 50.0 cm mark pivot 9 5.0 cm mark

 Fig. 3.1 (a) (i) Place the metre rule on the pivot. Place a mass M = 20 g with its centre at the 95.0 cm mark. Keeping the mass at the 95.0 cm mark, adjust the position of the metre rule on the pivot until the metre rule is as near to being balanced as possible. Record, in Table 3.1, the position of the pivot. (ii) Record in the table 

- the distance _a_ between the 50.0 cm mark and the pivot, 

- the distance _b_ between the 95.0 cm mark and the pivot.     **Table 3.1** _M_ / g position of pivot / cm _a_ / cm _b_ / cm _S_ 20 40 60 80 100 **(iii)** Repeat steps **(a)(i)** and **(a)(ii)** for values of _M_ = 40 g, 60 g, 80 g and 100 g. [2] **(b)** For each value of _M_ , calculate and record in the table the value _S_ , where _S_ = _ab_. [1]

 (c) Plot a graph of S ( y -axis) against M /g ( x -axis).

 (d) (i) Determine the gradient G of the graph. Show clearly on the graph how you obtained the necessary information.

 (ii) The mass M R of the metre rule is numerically equal to G^1. Write down a value for M R to a suitable number of significant figures for this experiment.

 (e) Determination of M R by this method relies on the centre of mass of the rule being at the 50.0 cm mark. Suggest how you could use the apparatus to test whether this is the case. You may draw a diagram. You are not asked to carry out the experiment.

**4** In this experiment, you will investigate how the insulation around a container affects the rate at which water cools. Two test-tubes, labelled **A** and **B** , have been set up for you. Test-tube **A** has one layer of insulation. Test-tube **B** has three layers of insulation. Carry out the following instructions, referring to Fig. 4.1.

 Fig. 4.1 (a) (i) Remove the cork and thermometer from test-tube A. Pour hot water into the test-tube, up to the level of the top of the insulation. (ii) Carefully replace the cork and thermometer. The water level will rise. (iii) Measure the temperature θ of the hot water and start the stopclock. Record this temperature in the first row of Table 4.1. (iv) Record in the table the temperature θ of the water at times t = 30 s, 60 s, 90 s, 120 s, 150 s and 180 s.
