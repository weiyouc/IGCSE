**2 (a)** Some students determine the speed of a car on a road. The students measure the time for the car to travel 30 m along the road. The time is 5.4 s. Calculate the average speed of the car. 

 average speed = ................................................ m / s [3] (b) Another car moves at a constant speed of 16 m / s for 4.0 seconds. During the next 2.0 seconds, the car decelerates from a speed of 16 m / s to a speed of 13 m / s. It then continues at a constant speed of 13 m / s for 3.0 seconds. On Fig. 2.1, plot the speed–time graph for the motion of the car during these 9.0 s.
