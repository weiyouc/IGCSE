## General information about practical exams 

Centres must follow the guidance on science practical exams given in the _Cambridge Handbook_. 

### Safety 

Supervisors must follow national and local regulations relating to safety and first aid. 

Only those procedures described in the question paper should be attempted. 

Supervisors must inform candidates that materials and apparatus used in the exam should be treated with caution. Suitable eye protection should be used where necessary. 

The following hazard codes are used in these confidential instructions, where relevant: 

 C corrosive MH moderate hazard HH health hazard T acutely toxic F flammable O oxidising N hazardous to the aquatic environment 

Hazard data sheets relating to substances used in this exam should be available from your chemical supplier. 

### Before the exam 

● The packets containing the question papers must **not** be opened before the exam. ● It is assumed that standard school laboratory facilities, as indicated in the _Guide to Planning Practical Science_ , will be available. ● Spare materials and apparatus for the tasks set must be available for candidates, if required. 

### During the exam 

● It must be made clear to candidates at the start of the exam that they may request spare materials and apparatus for the tasks set. ● Where specified, the supervisor **must** perform the experiments and record the results as instructed. This must be done **out of sight** of the candidates, using the same materials and apparatus as the candidates. ● Any assistance provided to candidates must be recorded in the supervisor’s report. ● If any materials or apparatus need to be replaced, for example, in the event of breakage or loss, this must be recorded in the supervisor’s report. 

### After the exam 

● The supervisor must complete a report for each practical session held and each laboratory used. ● Each packet of scripts returned to Cambridge International must contain the following items: 

 ● the scripts of the candidates specified on the bar code label provided ● the supervisor’s results relevant to these candidates ● the supervisor’s reports relevant to these candidates ● seating plans for each practical session, referring to each candidate by candidate number ● the attendance register.

## Specific information for this practical exam 

**Question 1** 

**Items to be supplied by the centre (per set of apparatus unless otherwise specified)** 

 (i) Metre rule with a mm scale. See note 1. 

 (ii) Triangular block to act as a pivot for the metre rule. This block is to stand on the bench. 

 (iii) A 200 g mass, labelled ‘ Q ’. See notes 2 and 3. 

 (iv) A set of masses of 200 g, 300 g, 400 g, 500 g and 600 g. The masses must be labelled 2.0 N, 3.0 N, 4.0 N, 5.0 N and 6.0 N respectively. See note 2. 

 (v) 50 cm rule with a mm scale. 

**Notes** 

**1.** If the metre rule has two scales in opposite directions, one scale must be taped over. 

**2.** Any suitable masses that can rest on the metre rule can be used. 

**3.** The value of the mass or weight of **Q** must not be visible to the candidates. 

**Action at changeover** 

Remove the masses from the metre rule. 

Remove the metre rule from the pivot. 

Check that the apparatus is ready for the next candidate.

**Question 2** 

**Items to be supplied by the centre (per set of apparatus unless otherwise specified)** 

 (i) Power supply of approximately 1.5 V–3 V. Where candidates are provided with a power supply with a variable output voltage, the voltage must be set by the supervisor and fixed (e.g. taped). See note 2. 

 (ii) Three identical lamps in suitable holders, labelled ‘L 1 ’, ‘L 2 ’ and ‘L 3 ’. Any low voltage lamps will suffice, provided that they glow when connected as shown in Fig. 2.1. 

 (iii) Switch. The switch may be an integral part of the power supply. 

 (iv) Ammeter capable of reading up to 1.00 A with a minimum precision of 0.05 A. See note 4. 

 (v) Voltmeter capable of measuring the supply potential difference (p.d.) with a minimum precision of 0.1 V. See note 4. 

 (vi) Sufficient connecting leads to construct the circuit shown in Fig. 2.1, with two additional leads. See note 3. 

 (vii) Spare lamps and spare leads. 

**Notes** 

**1.** The components are to be connected by the supervisor as shown in Fig. 2.1.

L (^1) **Fig. 2.1** 

**2.** If cells are to be used they must remain adequately charged throughout the examination. Spare     cells must be available. 

**3.** Candidates must be able easily and quickly to rearrange the circuit. 

**4.** Either analogue or digital meters are suitable. Any variable settings should be set by the supervisor     and fixed (e.g. taped). Spare meters must be available. 

**Action at changeover** 

Set up the circuit so that it is arranged as shown in Fig. 2.1. 

Check the power supply and lamps.

**Question 3** 

**Items to be supplied by the centre (per set of apparatus, unless otherwise specified)** 

 (i) Plane mirror with a suitable holder. See note 1. 

 (ii) Sheet of plain A4 paper with a hole in one corner (per candidate). Some spare sheets should be available. 

 (iii) 4 optics pins. 

 (iv) Pin board (e.g. a cork mat), A4 size or larger. 

 (v) Protractor (candidates may use their own). 

 (vi) 30 cm ruler, graduated in mm (candidates may use their own). 

 (vii) Treasury tag or string (to be used by the candidate to tie the ray-trace sheet into the Question Paper, one per candidate). 

**Notes** 

**1.** The mirror should be capable of standing vertically with one edge on the sheet of paper. The     height of the mirror must be less than the height of the optics pins, when stuck in the pin board. 

**Action at changeover** 

Supply a sheet of plain paper, as in **(ii)** above. 

Supply a treasury tag or string, as in **(vii)** above. 

**Question 4** 

No apparatus is required for this question.
