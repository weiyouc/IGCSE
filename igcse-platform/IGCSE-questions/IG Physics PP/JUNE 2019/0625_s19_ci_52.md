# General information about practical exams 

Centres must follow the guidance on science practical exams given in the _Cambridge Handbook_. 

## Safety 

Supervisors must follow national and local regulations relating to safety and first aid. 

Only those procedures described in the question paper should be attempted. 

Supervisors must inform candidates that materials and apparatus used in the exam should be treated with caution. Suitable eye protection should be used where necessary. 

## Before the exam 

 ● The packets containing the question papers must not be opened before the exam. ● It is assumed that standard school laboratory facilities, as indicated in the Guide to Planning Practical Science , will be available. ● Spare materials and apparatus for the tasks set must be available for candidates, if required. 

## During the exam 

 ● It must be made clear to candidates at the start of the exam that they may request spare materials and apparatus for the tasks set. ● Where specified, the supervisor must perform the experiments and record the results as instructed. This must be done out of sight of the candidates, using the same materials and apparatus as the candidates. ● Any assistance provided to candidates must be recorded in the supervisor’s report. ● If any materials or apparatus need to be replaced, for example, in the event of breakage or loss, this must be recorded in the supervisor’s report. 

## After the exam 

 ● The supervisor must complete a report for each practical session held and each laboratory used. ● Each packet of scripts returned to Cambridge International must contain the following items: 

 ● the scripts of the candidates specified on the bar code label provided ● the supervisor’s results relevant to these candidates ● the supervisor’s reports relevant to these candidates ● seating plans for each practical session, referring to each candidate by candidate number ● the attendance register.

# Specific information for this practical exam 

**Question 1** 

**Items to be supplied by the Centre (per set of apparatus unless otherwise specified)** 

 (i) Metre rule, with a mm scale. See note 1. 

 (ii) Triangular block to act as a pivot for the metre rule. This block is to stand on the bench. 

 (iii) 100 g mass labelled P. See note 2. 

 (iv) 80 g mass labelled Q. See note 2. 

**Notes** 

**1.** The metre rule should approximately balance on the pivot when the 50 cm mark is over the pivot. 

**2.** The masses must have a regular shape with a flat base so that they can be placed on the rule.     Laboratory masses or cubes of modelling clay are suitable. 

**Action at changeover** 

Check that the apparatus is ready for the next candidate.

**Question 2** 

**Items to be supplied by the Centre (per set of apparatus unless otherwise specified)** 

 (i) Thermometer, – 10 °C to 110 °C, graduated in 1 °C intervals. 

 (ii) 250 cm^3 beaker labelled A. 

 (iii) 250 cm^3 beaker labelled B. 

 (iv) A lid cut from card large enough to completely cover the top of beaker A. The lid must have a hole in the centre just large enough to accept the thermometer. See note 1. 

 (v) A rectangular piece of the same card as in (iv) , the same size as the lid. This piece of card will act as a mat for Beaker B. See note 2. 

 (vi) 100 cm^3 or 250 cm^3 measuring cylinder. 

 (vii) Stopclock or stopwatch or wall-mounted clock showing seconds. Candidates will be required to take readings at 30-second intervals. Candidates may use their own wristwatches. 

 The question will refer to a stopclock. 

 (viii) Supply of hot water. See notes 3 and 5. 

 (ix) Clamp, boss and stand. See note 4. 

 (x) Supply of paper towels to mop up any spills of water. 

**Notes** 

**1.** The card must be sufficiently thick to act as a rigid lid for beaker **A**. 

**2.** Beaker **B** must be placed on the mat. 

**3.** The hot water is to be supplied for each candidate by the Supervisor. The water should be     maintained at a temperature as hot as is reasonably and safely possible. Each candidate will     require about 600 cm^3 of hot water. 

**4.** The clamp, boss and stand must be set up for the candidates with the thermometer held in the     clamp. The thermometer bulb must be at a height well below the 200 cm^3 level of the beaker. 

**5.** Candidates should be warned of the dangers of burns or scalds when using very hot water. 

**6.** Spare lids, for beaker **A** and spare pieces of card for beaker **B** must be available. 

**Action at changeover** 

Empty the beakers and measuring cylinder. 

Check the lid for beaker **A** and the card for beaker **B** and replace if damaged or wet. 

Check the supply of hot water.

**Question 3** 

**Items to be supplied by the Centre (per set of apparatus unless otherwise specified)** 

 (i) Power supply of approximately 1.5 V – 3 V. Where candidates are provided with a power supply with a variable output voltage, the voltage must be set by the Supervisor and fixed (e.g. taped). See note 2. 

 (ii) Two resistors of nominal value 4.7 Ω with a power rating of at least 2 W. See note 3. 

 (iii) A lamp in a suitable holder. Any low voltage lamp will suffice, provided that it glows when connected as shown in Fig. 3.1. 

 (iv) Switch. The switch may be an integral part of the power supply. 

 (v) Ammeter capable of reading up to 1.00 A with a resolution of at least 0.05 A. See note 4. 

 (vi) Voltmeter capable of measuring the supply p.d. with a resolution of at least 0.1 V. See note 4. 

 (vii) Sufficient connecting leads to construct the circuit shown in Fig. 3.1, with two additional leads. 

**Notes** 

**1.** The circuit is to be connected by the Supervisor as shown in Fig. 3.1.

**2.** If cells are to be used, they must remain adequately charged throughout the examination. Spare     cells must be available. 

**3.** The resistors must be labelled **P** and **Q**. The values of resistance must not be visible to the     candidates. The resistors and the lamp must have suitable terminals so that candidates are able     easily and quickly to rearrange the circuit. 

**4.** Either analogue or digital meters are suitable. Any variable settings must be set by the Supervisor     and fixed (e.g. taped). Spare meters should be available. 

**Action at changeover** 

Set up the circuit so that it is arranged as shown in Fig. 3.1. 

Check that the circuit works. Switch off.
