**1** In this experiment, you will determine the weight of a metre rule using a balancing method. Carry out the following instructions, referring to Fig. 1.1. 

 90.0 cm mark 

50.0 cm mark (^) metre rule (^1000) bench pivot P _a b_ **Fig. 1.1 (a)** Place the metre rule on the pivot. Place the load P with its centre on the metre rule at the 90.0 cm mark. Keeping the load P at the 90.0 cm mark, adjust the position of the metre rule on the pivot so that the metre rule is as near as possible to being balanced. Measure, and record in the first row of Table 1.1, the distance _a_ from the 90.0 cm mark to the pivot. Measure, and record in the first row of Table 1.1, the distance _b_ from the pivot to the 50.0 cm mark. Repeat the steps above, placing the centre of the load P at the 85.0 cm, 80.0 cm, 75.0 cm and 70.0 cm marks. Record all values of _a_ and _b_ in Table 1.1. **Table 1.1** _a_ / cm _b_ / cm

 (b) Look carefully at the values of V l in Table 2.1. (i) Tick the box to show your conclusion from the results. V l is approximately constant. V l is decreasing as^ V^ increases. V l is increasing as^ V^ increases. There is no simple pattern for V l in the results.

**3** In this experiment, you will investigate the rate of cooling of water under different conditions. A greater rate of cooling occurs if there is a greater change in the temperature during the same period of time. Carry out the following instructions referring to Fig. 3.1. You are provided with a beaker labelled A and a can labelled B.

Place the lid on the beaker and place the thermometer in the beaker, as shown in Fig. 3.1. Record in Table 3.1 the temperature θ of the hot water at time t = 0. Immediately start the stopclock. After 30 s, measure the temperature θ shown on the thermometer. Record the time t = 30 s and the temperature reading in Table 3.1. Continue recording the time and the temperature readings every 30 s until you have six sets of readings. [3] Table 3.1 Table 3.2 beaker A can B t / s θ / ºC t / s θ / ºC

 (c) Pour 200 cm^3 of hot water into can B. Place the lid on the can and place the thermometer in the can. Record in Table 3.2 the temperature θ of the hot water at time t = 0. Immediately start the stopclock. After 30 s, measure the temperature θ shown on the thermometer. Record the time t = 30 s and the temperature reading in Table 3.2. Continue recording the time and temperature readings every 30 s until you have six sets of 

readings. (^) [2] **(d)** Look carefully at the readings in Table 3.1 and in Table 3.2. **(i)** Tick the box to show your conclusion from the readings. The water in the beaker has a greater rate of cooling than the water in the can. The water in the beaker has a smaller rate of cooling than the water in the can. There is no significant difference between the rates of cooling of the water in the beaker and the can. [1] **(ii)** Justify your conclusion by reference to your readings. ........................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................... ..................................................................................................................................... [2] **(e)** A student in another school carries out the experiment and reports that the rate of cooling of the water in the can is different from the rate of cooling of the water in the beaker. He plans a change to the experiment to find out whether this difference in the rates of cooling is caused by 

# • the matt black surface of the can being a better radiator of thermal energy than the shiny 

 surface of the beaker 

# • the metal of the can being a better conductor of thermal energy than the material of the 

 beaker. Suggest two suitable changes to the apparatus that the student could make.

**4** A student is investigating the work required to pull a box containing some masses up a sloping wooden board. Fig. 4.1 shows the board and the box. Plan an experiment to investigate how the work required to pull the box up the slope depends on the mass of the box and its contents. Work done is calculated using the equation: work done = force × distance moved in the direction of the force. You are **not** required to carry out this experiment. The following apparatus is available to the students: a wooden board a box with a length of string attached a selection of masses that fit in the box a metre rule an electronic balance. In your plan, you should: 

# • list any other apparatus that you would use 

# • explain briefly how you would carry out the investigation, including the measurements you 

 would take 

# • state the key variables that you would control 

# • draw a suitable table, with column headings, to show how you would display your readings 

 (you are not required to enter any readings in the table) 

# • explain how you would use the results to reach a conclusion. 

 You may add to the diagram if it helps your explanation. string wooden board
