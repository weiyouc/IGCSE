**PHYSICS 0625/53** Paper 5 Practical **October/November 2017** MARK SCHEME Maximum Mark: 40 

 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2017 series for most Cambridge IGCSE®^ , Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components.

 Question 

 Answer 

 Marks 

 1(a) 

# θ^ 

 for beaker A decreasing 

 1(b)(i) 

# θ^ 

 for beaker B decreasing, more slowly than for A AND all 

# θ^ 

 values to at least 1 

## °C 

 1(b)(ii) 

 units ALL correct (symbols or words) t^ values all present (30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180) 

 1(c) 

 two 

 appropriate precautions: e.g. avoidance of parallax(only if explained)wait until reading stops rising at startensure thermometer not touching beaker 

 1(d)(i) 

 conclusion matching results correct mention of comparative temperature change over 180 

 s^ 

 1(d)(ii) 

 any suitable improvement relating to comparison:e.g. same volume of water,same initial temperature,insulate sides,use plastic beaker,stand on mat,use a thicker 

 /^ more insulated lid, 

 matching explanation:e.g. lid only factor changed,cooling more rapid for higher temperaturescooling different for different volumes,thermal energy only escapes from surface,less transfer of thermal energy by sides,effect of lid more markedany appropriate similarity: 

 1(d)(iii) 

 e.g. both cool more rapidly at the start

 Question 

 Answer 

 Marks 

 3(a)(i) 

## 5 F 

 values all increasing all to at least 1d.p. 

 3(b)(ii) 

 any reliable methode.g. equal distances between rule and bench in at least two places,line up with named horizontal surface,use of set-square between stand and rule 

 3(b) 

 graph: axes labelled with quantity and unit appropriate scales (plots occupying at least ½ grid and scales starting at 0,0) plots all correct to ½ small square AND precise plots Well-judged line AND thin line 

 3(c)(i) 

## F^0 

 correct from graph 

 3(c)(ii) 

## W 

 in range 1 toR 

## 3 N 

## AND 2 

 /^ 3 sig figs and unit (N) 

 3(d) 

 statement matching plotted points AND explanation referring to line and scatter of data 

 3(e) 

 repeat all readings and take average

 Question 

 Answer 

 Marks 

## 4 

## MP1 

 additional apparatus: 

 screen AND (metre) rule 

## MP2 

 diagram: 

 suitable arrangement of apparatus with 

 u^ 

 and 

 v^ 

 labelled correctly 

## MP3 

 method: obtain (clear focused) image AND measure 

 u , 

 v 

## MP4 

 repeat for other values of 

 u^ 

## MP5 

 one precaution for clear, focused image: move screen slowly 

 /^ backwards and forwards, 

 object AND lens AND screen perpendicular to bench 

 /^ vertical, 

 object and lens at same height (from bench),use of dark room 

 /^ bright light 

## MP6 

 one precaution with measurements: clamp rule 

 /^ fix to bench, 

 mark centre of lens on holderavoidance of parallax explained and specific 

 MP7 

 one additional point: additional precaution,calculate 

 f^ from given equation 

 at least 3 values obtained,calculate average,mention of at least one appropriate 

 u^ 

 value, 

 mention of preliminary expt to obtain rough 

 f^ value (e.g. light from window)
