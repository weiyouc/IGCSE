**PHYSICS** Paper 3 Core Theory MARK SCHEMEMaximum Mark: 80 This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of theexamination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate thedetails of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would haveconsidered the acceptability of alternative answers.Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report forTeachers.Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2017 series for mostCambridge IGCSE **Cambridge Assessment International Education**^ Cambridge International General Certificate of Secondary Education® (^) , Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level (^) **Published October/November 20170625/31** components.
