It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would haveconsidered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report forTeachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2017 series for mostCambridge IGCSE® (^) , Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components.

 Question 

 Answer 

 Marks 

## 4 

## MP1 

 Stopwatch (or equivalent) AND (metre) rule 

 /^ ruler 

## MP2 

 Measure time for 5 (+) oscillations MP3 

 Divide by number of oscillations to find period ( 

## T )^ 

## MP4 

 Repeat for each bob MP5 

 Variable; 

 one 

 from: 

 Initial amplitude 

 /^ starting position 

 Length of pendulum 

 /^ thread 

 Number of oscillations MP6 

 Table with column headings for 

 t , or period ( 

 T ), or both 

## AND 

 d , with correct units 

## MP7 

 Conclusion:Plot graph(s) of 

 d^ against period ( 

 T ) or 

 t^ (or vice versa) 

 OR compare period ( 

 T ) or 

 t^ values for different diameters
