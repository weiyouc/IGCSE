Paper 4 Extended Theory MARK SCHEMEMaximum Mark: 80 **March 2020** 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the^ **Published** examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate thedetails of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would haveconsidered the acceptability of alternative answers.Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers.Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the March 2020 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components.

 Generic Marking Principles Page 2 of 15 

 These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside thespecific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with thesemarking principles.GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1:Marks must be awarded in line with:^ •^ the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question^ •^ the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question^ •^ the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts.GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2:Marks awarded are always 

 whole marks 

 (not half marks, or other fractions). 

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3:Marks must be awarded 

 positively 

## : 

-^ marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond thescope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate •^ marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do •^ marks are not deducted for errors •^ marks are not deducted for omissions •^ answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by thequestion as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4:Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic leveldescriptors.

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5:Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range maybe limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6:Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds orgrade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marksshould not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for anycorrect statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabusterms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane 

 /^ ethene, glucagon 

 /^ glycogen, refraction 

 /^ reflection). 

 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientificallycorrect way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme wherenecessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted.

 5 ‘List rule’ guidance (see examples below)For questions that require 

 n^ responses (e.g. State 

 two^ reasons …): 

-^ The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided •^ Any response marked 

 ignore^ in the mark scheme should not count towards 

 n 

-^ Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards 

 n 

-^ Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should 

 not^ be 

 awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, thisshould be treated as a single incorrect response • Non-contradictory responses after the first 

 n^ responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. 

 6 Calculation specific guidanceCorrect answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, 

 unless^ the question states ‘show 

 your working’.For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded bythe examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values.For answers given in standard form, (e.g. 

 n a × 10 ) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient ( 

 a ) to a value between 1 

 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme.Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded.Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equationsMultiples^ /^ fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme.State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme.

 NOTES ABOUT MARK SCHEME SYMBOLS AND OTHER MATTERS 

 B^ marks^ 

 are independent marks, which do not depend on other marks. For a B mark to be scored, the point to which it refers must beseen specifically in the candidate’s answer. M marks^ 

 are method marks upon which accuracy marks (A marks) later depend. For an M mark to be scored, the point to which itrefers^ must 

 be seen in a candidate's answer. If a candidate fails to score a particular M mark, then none of the dependent A marks can be scored. C marks^ 

 are compensatory marks in general applicable to numerical questions. These can be scored even if the point to which theyrefer are not written down by the candidate, 

 provided subsequent working gives evidence that they must have known it. 

 For example, if an equation carries a C mark and the candidate does not write down the actual equation but does correctsubstitution or working which shows he knew the equation, then the C mark is scored. A C mark is not awarded if a candidatemakes two points which contradict each other. Points which are wrong but irrelevant are ignored. A marks^ 

 A marks are accuracy or answer marks which either depend on an M mark, or which are one of the ways which allow a Cmark to be scored. A marks are commonly awarded for final answers to numerical questions. If a final numerical answer,eligible for A marks, is correct, with the correct unit and an acceptable number of significant figures, all the marks for thatquestion are awarded. However, an A mark following an M mark is a dependent mark and is only awarded if the M mark has been awarded. Brackets ( ) 

 Brackets around words or units in the mark scheme are intended to indicate wording used to clarify the mark scheme, but themarks do not depend on seeing the words or units in brackets, e.g. 10 

 (J) means that the mark is scored for 10, regardless of 

 the unit given. However, if a word in brackets is replaced with another word that is clearly wrong then the mark should not beawarded. Underlining 

 Underlining indicates that this 

 must^ be seen in the answer offered, or something very similar. 

 OR / or^ 

 This indicates alternative answers, any one of which is satisfactory for scoring the marks. eeoo.^ 

 This means ‘each error or omission’. owtte.^ 

 This means ‘or words to that effect’. Ignore^ 

 This indicates that something which is not correct or irrelevant i.e. it is not a contradiction (CON) is to be disregarded anddoes not incur a penalty.

 Spelling^ 

 Be generous about spelling and use of English. If an answer can be understood to mean what we want, give credit. However,do not allow ambiguities, e.g. spelling which suggests confusion between reflection / refraction / diffraction or thermistor /transistor / transformer. Not^ /^ NOT^ 

 This indicates that an incorrect answer is not to be disregarded, but cancels another otherwise correct alternative offered bythe candidate, i.e. right plus wrong penalty applies. ecf^ 

 meaning ‘error carried forward’ is mainly applicable to numerical questions, but may in particular circumstances be applied innon-numerical questions. This indicates that if a candidate has made an earlier mistake and has carried an incorrect valueforward to subsequent stages of working, marks indicated by ecf may be awarded, provided the subsequent working iscorrect, bearing in mind the earlier mistake. This prevents a candidate from being penalised more than once for a particularmistake, but 

 only^ applies to marks annotated ecf in the mark scheme. 

 Always annotate ecf if applied. 

 cao^ 

 correct answer only Significant Figures 

 Answers are normally acceptable to any number of significant figures 

## ⩾^ 2. 

 Any exceptions to this general rule will be specified in the mark scheme. Annotate with SF from the toolbar. A second (orfurther) sig. fig. error in a single question is not penalised; annotate with SF SF. It is normally acceptable to quote just 1 s.f.for answers, which are exact to 1 s.f Units^ 

 Deduct one mark for each incorrect or missing unit from an answer that would otherwise gain all the marks available for thatanswer:^ maximum 1 per question 

. No deduction is incurred if the unit is missing from the final answer but is shown correctly 

 in the working. Annotate with U.For more than one unit error in a question, annotate UU to indicate an error which has not been penalised.Unless listed here or stated in the mark scheme for the question, do not accept derived units e.g. kg 

 –2^ m s for N is NOT 

 acceptable. The following are acceptable alternatives: N 

 m for J, J^ s 

 –1^ –1 or N^ ms^ 

 for W, N^ m 

 –2^ for Pa, N 

 s and kg^ m 

 –1^ s are both 

 acceptable for both momentum and impulse.Beware: J NOT acceptable for moments.Condone wrong use of upper and lower case symbols, e.g. pA for Pa. Arithmetic errors 

 If the^ only 

 error in arriving at a final answer is clearly an arithmetic one, then the mark awarded will be one mark lower thanthe maximum mark.Regard a power-of-ten error as an arithmetic error unless otherwise specified in the mark scheme. Annotate with POT. Do notpenalise the same POT error more than once. Annotate POT POT. However if the power-of-ten error is due to the wrongomission or inclusion of 

 g^ (= 10^ N^ /^ 

 kg) this rule does not apply. 

 The use of a wrong SI prefix in the final answer is counted as a power-of-ten error rather than a unit error.

 Transcription errors 

 If the only error in arriving at a final answer is because previously calculated data has clearly been misread, but usedcorrectly, then for that part question the mark will be one less than the maximum mark. Fractions^ 

 Allow these only where specified in the mark scheme; they are a form of sig. fig. error; annotate with SF. Consequently, whena sig. fig. error and a fraction is used in the same question, the second answer may still be awarded full marks. Crossed out 

 Work which has been crossed out 

 and not replaced but can easily be read 

 , should be marked as if it had not been crossed 

 out. Look to see if it has been replaced on a blank page or another part of the same page. Use of^ NR^ 

 (# or / key on the keyboard). Use this if the answer space for a question is completely blank or contains no readable words,figures or symbols. 

 RM Assessor 3

 Guidance on the expression: words, symbols or numbers Accept numbers if, in the context of the question, that number can reasonably be a value for the quantity in the equation 

 /^ formula. 

 Accept alternative symbols that can reasonably represent the quantity in the equation but not if there is confusion with another quantity that isrepresented by that symbol in the syllabus e.g. Q is often acceptable for thermal energy but not if, as has happened, if there is confusion withcharge. Linking pages to other questions RM Assessor3 It is not unusual for candidates to write all or parts of answers to question outside the normal marking zone for that question. It is absolutely vitalthat such work is marked. Examiners need to follow up cases where candidates reach the end of the answer zone in the middle of a sentence orcross out all the work that fills the answer zone, or use an asterisk or arrowed line or otherwise to suggest that an answer is completed or replacedelsewhere on the paper.If all the extra work is clearly visible 

 in the next marking zone 

 there is no need to link it.

 In all other cases 

 where there is extra work that cannot be seen in the normal marking zone, examiners will need to use full screen mode to find the page which needs linking to a particular question and click ‘link to question’. The page is then automatically linked to that question and willappear below the zone for that question when marked. 

 Blank Pages and Blank AOs 

 There are no blank pages.Annotate with ‘seen’ from toolbar that you have seen any blank Additional Objects. 

 Annotation 

 To increase marking transparency, reduce the number of enquiries about results and assist team leaders, the following is mandatory: •^ For^ all^ 

 questions with two or more marks, examiners should tick to indicate where each credit is awarded. 

-^ For questions with one mark, examiners do not need to annotate the script to indicate that credit is awarded. •^ Any text annotation or annotation in a comment box should never contain –1 or allow a possible misinterpretation that negative marking wasapplied.Normally place the ticks close to where the mark is scored.
