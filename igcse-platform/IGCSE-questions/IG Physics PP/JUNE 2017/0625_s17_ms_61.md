 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of theexamination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would haveconsidered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report forTeachers. 

Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2017 series for most Cambridge IGCSECambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and some Cambridge O Level ®^ , components.

 Question 

 Answer 

 Marks 

## 5 

## MP1 

 Diagram showing power supply, ammeter, voltmeter and resistance wire correctly connected (variable resistor optional) MP2 

 Correct symbols for ammeter and voltmeter. Variable resistor symbol correct if included. MP3 

 Measure potential difference (voltage) and current and calculate resistance. MP4 

 Repeat with other (types of) wires MP5 

 Key variables length AND diameter stated MP6 

 One of: Repeat with different voltages (or currents).Repeat and take average (voltage and current) readings.Repeat entire experiment with different length or different diameter.Use low current to prevent wire heating up.Keep temperature of wire constant 

 /^ switch off between readings 

 Use micrometer screw gauge to measure diameter 

 /^ thickness of wire. 

## MP7 

 Table with columns for type of wire, voltage, current, resistance with correct units (V, A and 

## Ω)
