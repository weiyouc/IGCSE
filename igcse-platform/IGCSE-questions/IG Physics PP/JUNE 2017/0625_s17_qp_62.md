 Fig. 1.1 (a) A student places a sliding contact S on the resistance wire AB at a distance l = 0.200 m from point A. She measures the current I in the circuit and the potential difference V across the length l = 0.200 m of resistance wire. Figs. 1.2 and 1.3 show the voltmeter and ammeter readings.

# (a) • On Fig. 2.1, draw and label a normal NL at the centre of side AB. Label the point E 

 where the normal crosses AB. Label the point M where the normal crosses CD. [1] 

# • Draw a line FE , to the left of the normal and at an angle of incidence i = 40° to the 

 normal. 

# • Label the positions of two pins P 1 and P 2 on FE placed a suitable distance apart for 

 accurate ray tracing. [2]

 (b) The student observes the images of P 1 and P 2 through side CD of the block so that the images of P 1 and P 2 appear one behind the other. He places two pins P 3 and P 4 between his eye and the block so that P 3 and P 4 , and the images of P 1 and P 2 seen through the block, appear one behind the other. The positions of P 3 and P 4 are marked on Fig. 2.1. Draw a line joining the positions of P 3 and P 4. Continue the line until it meets the normal NL. Label the point K where this line crosses CD.

D = ...........................................................[1] (b) The student places the lens as shown in the diagram a distance u from the object. She then moves the screen until she obtains a clearly focused image on the screen. It is difficult to decide on the exact position of the screen that gives the best image. Explain how you would find the best position for the screen as reliably as possible. ................................................................................................................................................... ...............................................................................................................................................[1] (c) Another student uses a different lens and obtains these readings: u = ...............................................................15.0 cm v = ...............................................................29.7 cm

The following apparatus is available to the student: an electric fan with four speed settings a supply of hot water thermometer 250 cm 3 beaker 250 cm 3 measuring cylinder stopwatch clamp, boss and stand. Plan an experiment to investigate the effect of draughts on the rate of cooling of hot water. You should: 

# • explain briefly how you would carry out the investigation 

# • state the key variables that you would control 

# • draw a table, or tables, with column headings, to show how you would display your
