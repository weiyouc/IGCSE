It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate thedetails of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would haveconsidered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report forTeachers.Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2017 series for most Cambridge IGCSECambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and some Cambridge O Levelcomponents. ®^ ,

 Question 

 Answer^ 

 Marks 

 1(a)^ 

 5 I^ values, all increasing all < 5.00^ 

 A and to 2dp at least 1(b)^ 

 graph:axes labelled with quantity and unit appropriate scales (plots occupying at least ½ grid) plots all correct to ½ small square Well-judged straight line and thin line, precise plots 1(c)(i)^ 

 M^ present and triangle method seen on graph 1(c)(ii)^ 

 R^ in range 0.5 to 4.0 

## Ω^ 

 2 or 3 sig figs and unit = 

## Ω^ 

 1(d)^ 

 suitable reason:e.g.:wire becomes too hot,current exceeds full scale deflection(owtte) 

 of meter/becomes too large 

 1(e)^

 Question 

 Answer^ 

 Marks 

 2(a)^ 

 sensible value for 

 W (0.7 to 1.3^1 

## N)^ 

 2(b)(i)^ 

 sensible value for 

 V (140 to 160^1 

(^3) cm)^ 2(b)(ii)^ line of sight perpendicular to bottom of meniscus 2(c)^ _W_ <^ _W_ and^2 1 

## V >^ V^2 1 

 2(d)^ 

 correct calculation of 

 ρ^1 unit g / cm 

 3 2(e)^ 

 m >^ m by between 100^1 2 

 g and 200 

 g^ 

 2(f)^ 

 ρ and^ ρ^2 1 

 in range 0.9 to 1.1 2(g)^ 

 appropriate cause of inaccuracy:e.g.:^ •^ some water still in empty measuring cylinder^ •^ water spilled, splashed when putty put in waterwater drops on putty when removed^ •^ air bubbles on putty suitable improvement:e.g.:^ •^ measure 

 m at start (when cylinder dry)^2 

-^ measure new volume in Method OR refill to correct value •^ shake putty to remove air / smooth surface to minimise bubbles
