**PHYSICS** Paper 4 Extended Theory (^) **May/June 20170625/43** MARK SCHEMEMaximum Mark: 80 **Published** This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of theexamination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would haveconsidered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report forTeachers. Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2017 series for most Cambridge IGCSECambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and some Cambridge O Level ®^ , components.
