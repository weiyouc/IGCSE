# General information about practical exams 

Centres must follow the guidance on science practical exams given in the _Cambridge Handbook_. 

## Safety 

Supervisors must follow national and local regulations relating to safety and first aid. 

Only those procedures described in the question paper should be attempted. 

Supervisors must inform candidates that materials and apparatus used in the exam should be treated with caution. Suitable eye protection should be used where necessary. 

## Before the exam 

 ● The packets containing the question papers must not be opened before the exam. ● It is assumed that standard school laboratory facilities, as indicated in the Guide to Planning Practical Science , will be available. ● Spare materials and apparatus for the tasks set must be available for candidates, if required. 

## During the exam 

 ● It must be made clear to candidates at the start of the exam that they may request spare materials and apparatus for the tasks set. ● Where specified, the supervisor must perform the experiments and record the results as instructed. This must be done out of sight of the candidates, using the same materials and apparatus as the candidates. ● Any assistance provided to candidates must be recorded in the supervisor’s report. ● If any materials or apparatus need to be replaced, for example, in the event of breakage or loss, this must be recorded in the supervisor’s report. 

## After the exam 

 ● The supervisor must complete a report for each practical session held and each laboratory used. ● Each packet of scripts returned to Cambridge International must contain the following items: 

 ● the scripts of the candidates specified on the bar code label provided ● the supervisor’s results relevant to these candidates ● the supervisor’s reports relevant to these candidates ● seating plans for each practical session, referring to each candidate by candidate number ● the attendance register.

# Specific information for this practical exam 

**Question 1** 

**Items to be supplied by the Centre (per set of apparatus unless otherwise specified)** 

 (i) Metre rule with a mm scale. See note 1. 

 (ii) Triangular block to act as a pivot for the metre rule. This block is to stand on the bench. 

 (iii) Masses of 50 g, 80 g, 100 g, 120 g and 150 g labelled 0.5 N , 0.8 N , 1.0 N , 1.2 N and 1.5 N respectively. See note 2. 

**Notes** 

**1.** If the metre rule has two scales in opposite directions, one scale must be taped over. 

**2.** The triangular block can be made of any solid material that is durable enough to support the ruler     **(i)** and the masses in **(iii)**. When placed on a surface with its apex pointing upward, the height of     the apex should be about 5–8 cm above the surface. 

**3.** Any suitable masses that can rest on the metre rule can be used. Slotted masses taped together     are suitable. 

**Action at changeover** 

Remove the masses from the rule. 

Remove the rule from the pivot. 

Check that the apparatus is ready for the next candidate.

**Question 2** 

**Items to be supplied by the Centre (per set of apparatus unless otherwise specified)** 

 (i) Power supply with an output potential difference (p.d.) of 1.5 V–3 V. Where candidates are provided with a power supply with a variable output p.d., the p.d. must be set by the Supervisor and fixed (e.g. taped). See note 2. 

 (ii) Three identical lamps in suitable holders. Any lamps will suffice, provided that they glow when connected as shown in Fig. 2.1. See note 3. 

 (iii) Switch. The switch may be an integral part of the power supply. 

 (iv) Ammeter capable of reading up to 1.00 A with a resolution of at least 0.05 A. See note 4. 

 (v) Voltmeter capable of measuring the supply p.d. with a resolution of at least 0.1 V. See note 4. 

 (vi) Sufficient connecting leads to construct the circuit shown in Fig. 2.1, with two additional leads. 

 (vii) Spare lamps should be available. 

**Notes** 

**1.** The circuit is to be connected by the Supervisor as shown in Fig. 2.1. 

### A 

### V

L (^1) **Fig. 2.1** 

**2.** If cells are to be used, they must remain adequately charged throughout the examination. Spare     cells must be available. 

**3.** The lamps must be labelled L 1 , L 2 and L 3. The lamps must have suitable terminals so that     candidates are able easily and quickly to rearrange the circuit. Spare lamps should be available. 

**4.** Either analogue or digital meters are suitable. Any variable settings must be set by the Supervisor     and fixed (e.g. taped). Spare meters should be available. 

**Action at changeover** 

Set up the circuit so that it is arranged as shown in Fig. 2.1. 

Check that the circuit and all the lamps work. Switch off.

**Question 3** 

**Items to be supplied by the Centre (per set of apparatus, unless otherwise specified)** 

 (i) Thermometer, –10 °C to 110°C, graduated in 1°C intervals. 

 (ii) 250 cm 3 beaker. 

 (iii) 250 cm 3 measuring cylinder. 

 (iv) Stopclock or stopwatch or wall-mounted clock showing seconds. Candidates will be required to take readings at 60-second intervals. Candidates may use their own wristwatches. The question will refer to a stopclock. 

 (v) Supply of hot water. See notes 1 and 2. 

 (vi) Supply of paper towels to mop up any spills of water. 

**Notes** 

**1.** The hot water is to be supplied for each candidate by the Supervisor. The water should be     maintained at a temperature as hot as is reasonably and safely possible. Each candidate will     require about 300 cm 3 of hot water. 

**2.** Candidates should be warned of the dangers of burns or scalds when using hot water. 

**Action at changeover** 

Empty the beaker and measuring cylinder. 

Check the supply of hot water. 

**Question 4** 

No apparatus is required for this question.
