### (a) • He places the screen at a fixed distance from the illuminated object. 

- He places the lens between the object and the screen so that the lens is very close to     the screen. 

- He moves the lens slowly away from the screen until a clearly focused image is formed     on the screen. 

- He measures the distance _u_ between the object and the centre of the lens and the     distance _v_ between the centre of the lens and the screen. The readings are shown in     Table 3.1.

### (c) • The student keeps the screen at the same fixed distance D from the illuminated object. 

- He moves the lens slowly away from the screen. The image goes out of focus.

**4** A student investigates the time taken for ice cubes in a container to melt using different insulating materials on the container. 

 The following apparatus is available: 

 a copper container a variety of insulating materials that can be wrapped round the copper container a thermometer a stopwatch a supply of ice cubes 

 The student can also use other apparatus and materials that are usually available in a school laboratory. 

 Plan an experiment to investigate the time taken for ice cubes to melt using different insulating materials. 

 In your plan, you should: 

- draw a diagram of the apparatus used 

- explain briefly how you would carry out the investigation 

- state the key variables that you would control 

- draw a table, or tables, with column headings, to show how you would display your readings     (you are **not** required to enter any readings in the table) 

- explain how you would use your readings to reach a conclusion.
