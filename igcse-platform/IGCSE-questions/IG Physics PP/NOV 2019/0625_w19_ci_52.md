# General information about practical exams 

Centres must follow the guidance on science practical exams given in the _Cambridge Handbook_. 

## Safety 

Supervisors must follow national and local regulations relating to safety and first aid. 

Only those procedures described in the question paper should be attempted. 

Supervisors must inform candidates that materials and apparatus used in the exam should be treated with caution. Suitable eye protection should be used where necessary. 

## Before the exam 

 ● The packets containing the question papers must not be opened before the exam. ● It is assumed that standard school laboratory facilities, as indicated in the Guide to Planning Practical Science , will be available. ● Spare materials and apparatus for the tasks set must be available for candidates, if required. 

## During the exam 

 ● It must be made clear to candidates at the start of the exam that they may request spare materials and apparatus for the tasks set. ● Where specified, the supervisor must perform the experiments and record the results as instructed. This must be done out of sight of the candidates, using the same materials and apparatus as the candidates. ● Any assistance provided to candidates must be recorded in the supervisor’s report. ● If any materials or apparatus need to be replaced, for example, in the event of breakage or loss, this must be recorded in the supervisor’s report. 

## After the exam 

 ● The supervisor must complete a report for each practical session held and each laboratory used. ● Each packet of scripts returned to Cambridge International must contain the following items: 

 ● the scripts of the candidates specified on the bar code label provided ● the supervisor’s results relevant to these candidates ● the supervisor’s reports relevant to these candidates ● seating plans for each practical session, referring to each candidate by candidate number ● the attendance register.

# Specific information for this practical exam 

**Apparatus for Question 1** 

**Items to be supplied by the centre (per set of apparatus unless otherwise specified)** 

 (i) Clamp, boss and stand. 

 (ii) Pendulum bob attached to approximately 110 cm of thin inextensible string. 

 (iii) Metre rule, graduated in mm. 

 (iv) Stopwatch with a minimum precision of 0.1 s. Candidates may use their own wristwatch if they wish. 

 (v) Split cork or similar device to hold the string of the pendulum between the jaws of the clamp. 

**Notes** 

**1.** The pendulum should be set up for the candidates with length approximately 60 cm from the     bottom of the split cork to the bottom of the pendulum bob. 

**2.** Candidates must be able easily to adjust the length of the pendulum up to a length of 100 cm. 

**3.** It may be necessary to increase the stability of the clamp stand (for example, using a G-clamp or     by placing a weight on the base). 

**Action at changeover** 

Arrange the pendulum as described in Note 1.

**Apparatus for Question 2** 

**Items to be supplied by the centre (per set of apparatus unless otherwise specified)** 

 (i) Power supply of approximately 1.5 V – 3 V. Where candidates are provided with a power supply with a variable output voltage, the voltage must be set by the Supervisor and fixed (e.g. taped). See note 2. 

 (ii) Switch. The switch may be an integral part of the power supply. 

 (iii) Ammeter capable of reading up to 1.00 A with a resolution of at least 0.05 A. See note 3. 

 (iv) Voltmeter capable of measuring the supply p.d. with a resolution of at least 0.1 V. See note 3. 

 (v) Metre rule, graduated in mm. See notes 1, 4 and 5. 

 (vi) Approximately 105 cm of straight, bare constantan (Eureka) wire. The resistance of the wire must be in the range 5 Ω – 8 Ω. Diameter 0.45 mm (26 swg) or 0.38 mm (28 swg) or 0.32 mm (30 swg) are suitable. The wire must be taped to the metre rule only between the 3 cm and 7 cm marks and between the 93 cm and 97 cm marks. The end of the wire at the zero end of the rule is to be labelled P. See note 4. 

 (vii) Two suitable terminals (e.g. crocodile clips) attached to the constantan wire at the ends of the metre rule so that connections can be made to the circuit shown in Fig. 2.1. 

 (viii) Sliding contact, labelled ‘ C ’. This may be a jockey or a small screwdriver connected to a lead by means of a crocodile clip. 

 (ix) Sufficient connecting leads to set up the circuit shown in Fig. 2.1. 

**Notes** 

**1.** The circuit is to be set up for the candidates as shown in Fig. 2.1.

**2.** If cells are to be used, they must remain adequately charged throughout the examination. Spare     cells should be available. 

**3.** Either analogue or digital meters are suitable. Any variable settings should be set by the Supervisor     and fixed (e.g. taped). Spare meters should be available. 

**4.** The wire must be attached to the metre rule as shown in Fig. 2.2. 

**5.** If the metre rule has two scales in opposite directions, one scale must be taped over. 

**Action at changeover** 

Check that the circuit is arranged as shown in Fig. 2.1. 

Check that the circuit works. Switch off.
