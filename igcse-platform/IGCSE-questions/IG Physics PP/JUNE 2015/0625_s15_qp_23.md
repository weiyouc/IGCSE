 (c) The difference in the length of the candle from the start to the end of the experiment was 1.8 cm. Calculate the rate, in cm / hour, at which the candle burns. 

 rate = ........................................... cm / hour [2] (d) The boy estimates that he would need a candle about 24 cm long, of the same material and diameter, to make a candle timer that would last at least one day. State whether the boy’s estimate is correct. Give a reason for your answer.
