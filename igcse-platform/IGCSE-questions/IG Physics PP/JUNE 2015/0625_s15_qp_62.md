 (b) The student displaces the pendulum bob slightly and releases it so that it swings. She measures the time t for 20 complete oscillations of the pendulum (see Fig. 1.2). 

 (i) Record the time t , in s, shown on the stopwatch in Fig. 1.3.

 t = ....................................................... s [1] 

 (ii) Calculate the period T of the pendulum. The period is the time for one complete oscillation. 

 T = ...........................................................[1] 

 (iii) Explain why measuring the time for 20 oscillations, rather than 1 oscillation, gives a more accurate value for T.

 .......................................................................................................................................[1] 

 (c) The student adjusts the length of the pendulum until its length l = 100.0 cm. She repeats the procedure and obtains a value for the period T. 

 T = ...............................................................^ 2.06 s 

 Another student suggests that doubling the length l of the pendulum should double the period T. 

 State whether the results support this suggestion. Justify your answer by reference to the results.

 (d) To continue the investigation of the relationship between the length l of the pendulum and the period T , it is necessary to use a range of values of length l. 

 List additional l values that you would plan to use in the laboratory.

 (a) On Fig. 4.1, the mirror is placed along the line MR. Label the normal NL. [1] 

 (b) The student places two pins P 1 and P 2 on line AB at a suitable distance apart, so that she can accurately observe the reflection of line AB. 

 Suggest a suitable distance between the two pins. 

 distance = ...........................................................[1]

 (c) The student determines the angle between the reflected ray and the normal by viewing the images of pins P 1 and P 2 from the direction indicated by the eye in Fig. 4.1. She places two pins P 3 and P 4 , some distance apart, so that pins P 3 and P 4 , and the images of P 2 and P 1 , all appear exactly one behind the other. She draws a line joining the positions of P 3 and P 4. 

 She measures the angle α between the normal and the line joining the positions of P 3 and P 4. At this stage the angle θ between the mirror and line MR is 0 °, as shown in Table 4.1. 

 She moves the mirror to a new position, shown by the dotted line on Fig. 4.1, at an angle θ = 10 ° to MR. She repeats the procedure with pins P 3 and P 4. 

 She continues using angles θ = 20 °, 30 ° and 40 °. The readings are shown in Table 4.1.
