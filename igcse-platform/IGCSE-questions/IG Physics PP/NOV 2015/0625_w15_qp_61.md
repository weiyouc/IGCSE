He places two pins P 3 and P 4 , a suitable distance apart, so that pins P 3 and P 4 , and the images of P 2 and P 1 , all appear exactly one behind the other. The positions of P 3 and P 4 are shown in Fig. 3.1. (i) Draw the line joining the positions of P 3 and P 4. Extend the line until it meets NL.
