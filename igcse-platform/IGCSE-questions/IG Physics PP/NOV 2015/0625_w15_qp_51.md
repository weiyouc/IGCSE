 (d) A student suggests that T C should be equal to T S. State whether your results support this suggestion. Justify your answer by reference to the results. statement .................................................................................................................................. justification ................................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................................................... ...................................................................................................................................................

He was expecting that the temperature θ (^) M of the mixture would be the same as the average temperature θ (^) A of the hot water and cold water. Suggest two factors that could cause θ (^) M and θ (^) A to be different.

 (a) Draw a line 10.0 cm long near the middle of your ray-trace sheet. Label the line MR. Draw a normal to this line that passes through its centre. Label the normal NL. Label the point at which NL crosses MR with the letter A. (b) Draw a line 8.0 cm long from A at an angle of incidence i = 30° to the normal, below MR and to the left of the normal. Label the end of this line B. (c) Place the reflecting face of the mirror vertically on the line MR. (d) Place a pin P 1 at point B , 8.0 cm from the point A. (e) Place pin P 2 on line AB a suitable distance from pin P 1. (f) View the images of pins P 1 and P 2 from the direction indicated by the eye in Fig. 4.1. Place two pins P 3 and P 4 , a suitable distance apart, so that pins P 3 and P 4 , and the images of P 2 and P 1 , all appear exactly one behind the other. Label the positions of P 3 and P 4. (g) Remove the pins and the mirror. Draw the line joining the positions of P 3 and P 4. Extend the line until it meets NL. (h) Measure, and record in Table 4.1, the angle r between NL and the line joining the positions of P 3 and P 4. Table 4.1 i / ° r / ° 30 [2] (i) Draw a second normal to line MR , 2.0 cm to the right of NL. Label the normal XY. Label the point at which XY crosses MR with the letter C. Draw the line BC. Measure, and record in the table, the angle i between BC and XY. (j) Place pin P 1 at point B. Place pin P 2 on line BC a suitable distance from pin P 1. (k) Repeat the procedure in parts (f) and (g) using the new normal XY. (l) Measure, and record in the table, the angle r between XY and the line joining the new positions of P 3 and P 4.

 (n) A student has done this experiment very carefully, taking these precautions. She is disappointed to find that her lines for the reflected rays are not exactly where she predicts from the theory. Suggest a practical reason for this. ...............................................................................................................................................[1] Tie your ray-trace sheet into this Booklet between pages 10 and 11.
