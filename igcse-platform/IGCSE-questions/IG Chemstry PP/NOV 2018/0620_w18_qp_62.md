**2** A student investigated the rate of reaction between solution **L** , solution **M** and hydrochloric acid. When these chemicals react they form iodine. Sodium thiosulfate solution and starch solution were used to show how fast the reaction proceeded. 

 Five experiments were done. 

 Experiment 1 

 ● A measuring cylinder was used to add 10 cm^3 of solution L to a conical flask. ● 10 cm 3 of dilute hydrochloric acid, 10 cm^3 of sodium thiosulfate solution and 1 cm^3 of starch solution were then added to the conical flask. ● The reaction was started by using a measuring cylinder to add 10 cm^3 of solution M to the conical flask. A timer was started immediately and the mixture was swirled. ● The time taken for the mixture to turn blue-black was measured. ● The conical flask was emptied and rinsed with distilled water. 

 Experiment 2 

 ● A measuring cylinder was used to add 8 cm^3 of solution L and 2 cm 3 of distilled water to the conical flask. ● 10 cm 3 of dilute hydrochloric acid, 10 cm^3 of sodium thiosulfate solution and 1 cm^3 of starch solution were then added to the conical flask. ● The reaction was started by using a measuring cylinder to add 10 cm^3 of solution M to the conical flask. The timer was started immediately and the mixture was swirled. ● The time taken for the mixture to turn blue-black was measured. ● The conical flask was emptied and rinsed with distilled water. 

 Experiment 3 

 ● Experiment 2 was repeated but 6 cm^3 of solution L and 4 cm 3 of distilled water were added to the conical flask before adding the other reagents. 

 Experiment 4 

 ● Experiment 2 was repeated but 5 cm^3 of solution L and 5 cm 3 of distilled water were added to the conical flask before adding the other reagents. 

 Experiment 5 

 ● Experiment 2 was repeated but 3 cm^3 of solution L and 7 cm 3 of distilled water were added to the conical flask before adding the other reagents.
