**2** A student investigated the rate of reaction between solution **S** and solution **T** at different temperatures. When these chemicals react they form iodine. Sodium thiosulfate solution and starch solution were used to show how fast the reaction proceeded. 

 Four experiments were done. 

 Experiment 1 

 ● A measuring cylinder was used to add 10 cm^3 of solution S and 10 cm 3 of sodium thiosulfate solution to a conical flask. ● A teat pipette was then used to add 1 cm^3 of starch solution to the mixture. ● The temperature of the mixture was measured and recorded in the table. ● The reaction was started by using a measuring cylinder to add 10 cm^3 of solution T to the conical flask. A timer was started immediately and the mixture was swirled. ● The time taken for the mixture to turn blue-black was measured. ● The final temperature of the mixture was measured and recorded. ● The conical flask was emptied and rinsed with distilled water. 

 Experiment 2 

 ● A measuring cylinder was used to add 10 cm^3 of solution S and 10 cm 3 of sodium thiosulfate solution to the conical flask. ● A teat pipette was then used to add 1 cm^3 of starch solution to the mixture. ● The mixture was then heated to about 30 °C. ● The temperature of the mixture was measured and recorded in the table. ● The reaction was started by using a measuring cylinder to add 10 cm^3 of solution T to the conical flask. The timer was started immediately and the mixture was swirled. ● The time taken for the mixture to turn blue-black was measured. ● The final temperature of the mixture was measured and recorded. ● The conical flask was emptied and rinsed with distilled water. 

 Experiment 3 

 ● Experiment 2 was repeated but the mixture of solution S , sodium thiosulfate solution and starch solution in the conical flask was heated to about 40 °C before adding solution T. 

 Experiment 4 

 ● Experiment 2 was repeated but the mixture of solution S , sodium thiosulfate solution and starch solution in the conical flask was heated to about 50 °C before adding solution T.
