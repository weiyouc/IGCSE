**1** You are going to investigate the rate of reaction between solution **L** , solution **M** and hydrochloric acid. When these chemicals react they form iodine. Sodium thiosulfate solution and starch solution can be used to show how fast the reaction proceeds. 

 Read all the instructions carefully before starting the experiments. 

 Instructions You are going to do five experiments. 

 Experiment 1 

 ● Place the conical flask on the white tile. Use measuring cylinder A to add 10 cm^3 of solution^ L to the conical flask. ● Now use measuring cylinder A to add 10 cm 3 of dilute hydrochloric acid and 10 cm^3 of sodium thiosulfate solution to the conical flask. ● Use the teat pipette to add about 1 cm^3 of starch solution to the mixture. ● Use measuring cylinder B to start the reaction by adding 10 cm 3 of solution M to the conical flask. Start the timer immediately and swirl the mixture. ● Measure the time taken for the mixture to turn blue-black and record the time taken in the table on page 4. ● Empty the conical flask and rinse it with distilled water. 

 Experiment 2 

 ● Place the conical flask on the white tile. Use measuring cylinder A to add 8 cm^3 of solution L and 2 cm 3 of distilled water to the conical flask. ● Now use measuring cylinder A to add 10 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid and 10 cm^3 of sodium thiosulfate solution to the conical flask. ● Use the teat pipette to add about 1 cm^3 of starch solution to the mixture. ● Use measuring cylinder B to add 10 cm 3 of solution M to the conical flask. Start the timer immediately and swirl the mixture. ● Measure the time taken for the mixture to turn blue-black and record the time taken in the table on page 4. ● Empty the conical flask and rinse it with distilled water. 

 Experiment 3 

 ● Repeat Experiment 2 but add 6 cm^3 of solution L and 4 cm^3 of distilled water to the conical flask before adding the other reagents. 

 Experiment 4 

 ● Repeat Experiment 2 but add 5 cm^3 of solution L and 5 cm^3 of distilled water to the conical flask before adding the other reagents. 

 Experiment 5 

 ● Repeat Experiment 2 but add 3 cm^3 of solution L and 7 cm^3 of distilled water to the conical flask before adding the other reagents.
