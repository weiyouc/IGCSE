**2** A student investigated the rate of reaction between dilute nitric acid and lumps of magnesium carbonate. The apparatus shown was used. 

 balance 

 cotton wool 

dilute nitric acid (^) lumps of magnesium carbonate Lumps of magnesium carbonate were added to a conical flask. 40 cm^3 of dilute nitric acid was then poured into the conical flask using a measuring cylinder. The magnesium carbonate was in **excess**. The conical flask was placed on a balance. Cotton wool was placed in the top of the conical flask. The mass of the conical flask and its contents was measured and a timer was started. The mass of the conical flask and its contents was measured every minute for 7 minutes. 


**©UCLES 2018 0620/61/O/N/18** 

 (a) Use the balance diagrams to record the mass of the conical flask and its contents in the table. Complete the table to work out the total loss of mass of the conical flask and its contents since the start of the experiment.

**3** Two solid salts, solid **G** and solid **H** , were analysed. Tests were done on each solid. 

 tests on solid G 

 Some of the tests and observations are shown. 

 tests on solid G observations 

 test 1 

 A flame test was done on solid G. lilac colour 

 Solid G was dissolved in distilled water. 

 test 2 

 Dilute hydrochloric acid was added to the solution. The solution was warmed gently. The gas produced was tested with filter paper which had been dipped in acidified aqueous 

# potassium manganate(VII). 

 filter paper turned from purple to colourless

 tests on solid H 

 Solid H was calcium nitrate. 

 Complete the expected observations. 

 Solid H was added to distilled water in a test-tube. The test-tube was shaken to dissolve solid H. The solution was divided into four portions in four test-tubes. 

 (c) (i) Drops of aqueous sodium hydroxide were added to the first portion of the solution.

**4** Propanone and ethyl ethanoate are both solvents which can be used to remove paint. 

 Plan an investigation to determine which of these two solvents is better to use to remove paint. 

 You are provided with glass slides, paint, the two solvents and common laboratory apparatus.
