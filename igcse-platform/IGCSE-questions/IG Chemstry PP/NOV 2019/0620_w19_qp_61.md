**2** A student investigated the rate of reaction between dilute nitric acid and an excess of solid magnesium carbonate at room temperature. 

 The apparatus was set up as shown in the diagram. 

 A small test‑tube containing magnesium carbonate was suspended in the conical flask.

 solid magnesium carbonate 

 inverted 250 cm^3 measuring cylinder 

 dilute nitric acid 

 50 cm 3 of dilute nitric acid was added to the conical flask. The contents of the test‑tube were released, allowing the solid magnesium carbonate to mix with the dilute nitric acid. A stop‑clock was started and the volume of gas collected in the inverted measuring cylinder was measured every 10 seconds for 80 seconds.

 4 Iodine dissolves in two different solvents: ethanol and hexane. 

 Plan an experiment to find out in which solvent iodine is the most soluble at room temperature. 

 You are provided with iodine, the two solvents and common laboratory apparatus.
