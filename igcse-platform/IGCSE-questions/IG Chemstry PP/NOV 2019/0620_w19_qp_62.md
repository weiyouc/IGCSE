**1** A student did a single titration to find the concentration of a solution of dilute sulfuric acid. The student added 25.0 cm^3 of aqueous sodium hydroxide to a conical flask, followed by a few drops of indicator. Dilute sulfuric acid was then added to the aqueous sodium hydroxide until the solution was neutral. The apparatus used is shown in the diagram.

**2** A student investigated the temperature changes when two different solids, **N** and **O** , dissolve in water. Two experiments were done. _Experiment 1_ ● Using a measuring cylinder, 30 cm^3 of distilled water was poured into a polystyrene cup. ● The initial temperature of the distilled water was measured. ● Solid **N** was added to the distilled water, a timer started and the mixture was stirred with a stirring thermometer. ● The temperature of the mixture was measured every 30 seconds for three minutes (180 seconds). **(a)** Use the thermometer diagrams to record the temperatures in the table.

# 3 Two substances, solid P and solid Q , were analysed. Solid P was copper(II) nitrate. 

 Tests were done on solid P and solid Q. tests on solid P Complete the expected observations. (a) A flame test was done on solid P. observations ........................................................................................................................ [1] Solid P was added to distilled water and the mixture shaken to dissolve solid P and form solution P. Solution P was divided into three equal portions in two test‑tubes and one boiling tube. (b) An excess of aqueous sodium hydroxide was added to the first portion of solution P in a test‑tube. observations ........................................................................................................................ [1] (c) (i) A few drops of aqueous ammonia were added to the second portion of solution P in a test‑tube. observations ................................................................................................................. [1] (ii) An excess of aqueous ammonia was then added to this mixture. observations .................................................................................................................
