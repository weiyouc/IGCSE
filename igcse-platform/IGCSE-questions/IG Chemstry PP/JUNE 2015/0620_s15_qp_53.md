**1** You are going to investigate what happens when four different solids, **D** , **E** , **F** and **G** , react with excess dilute hydrochloric acid. The solids are all calcium compounds. 

 Read all the instructions below carefully before starting the experiments. 

 Instructions You are going to carry out four experiments. 

 (a) Experiment 1 

 Use a measuring cylinder to pour 30 cm 3 of hydrochloric acid into the polystyrene cup supported in the beaker provided. Measure the temperature of the hydrochloric acid and record it in the table below. Add all of solid D to the hydrochloric acid and stir the mixture with the thermometer. 

 Measure the temperature reached by the liquid mixture. Record your result in the table. Record any observations. 

 observations .............................................................................................................................. 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [1] 

 Empty the polystyrene cup and rinse it with water. 

 (b) Experiment 2 

 Repeat Experiment 1 using solid E. Record your results in the table. 

 (c) Experiment 3 

 Repeat Experiment 1 using solid F. Record your results in the table. 

 (d) Experiment 4 

 Repeat Experiment 1 using solid G but add 3-4 drops of Universal Indicator solution to the hydrochloric acid before adding the solid. Record your results in the table and note any observations below.

 tests on solid H 

 (a) Describe the appearance of solid H. ................................................................ [1] 

 (b) Use a spatula to put half of solid H into a hard-glass test-tube. Heat the solid gently and then strongly. 

 Test any gases given off with damp pH indicator paper.

 (c) Add about 10 cm 3 of distilled water to the rest of solid H , stopper and shake to dissolve. Describe the appearance of the solution. ................................................................ [1] 

 Divide the solution into four equal portions in four test-tubes. 

 Carry out the following tests. 

 (d) To the first portion of the solution, add aqueous sodium hydroxide using a teat pipette and shake the test-tube. 

 Now add excess sodium hydroxide to the test-tube. 

 Heat the mixture gently and test any gases given off.
