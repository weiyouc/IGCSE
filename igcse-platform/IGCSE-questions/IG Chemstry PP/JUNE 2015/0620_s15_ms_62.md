# CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL EXAMINATIONS Cambridge International General Certificate of Secondary Education MARK SCHEME for the May/June 2015 series 0620 CHEMISTRY 

## This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements ofthe examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does notindicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal ExaminerReport for Teachers.Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.^ 0620/62^ Paper 6 (Alternative to Practical), maximum raw mark 60

 Answer^ 

 Marks^ Guidance 7 Generic marking points can be applied to any method:^ mp1 (fair testing)known or stated volume of tonic water;mp2 (fair testing)repeat with other sample of tonic water;mp3 (reagent)add or react with KOH or Mg turnings etc.;mp4 (method)use of indicator^ /^ collect gas etc.;mp5 (endpoint)until colour changes^ /^ until no more gas evolved 

 /^ for one minute etc.; mp6 (measurement)volume of KOH added^ /^ volume of gas evolved;mp7 (conclusion)the higher concentration is the one that needs the greater volume of KOH 

### / 

 gives off the most gas etc.;^ 

 There are many possible methods. Themost common is titration by either addingtonic water to KOH or KOH to tonic water.However, reagents such as Mg orcarbonates would also work. A^ a pH meter^ /^ probe could work. Thevolume of the tonic water does not matter,so mp1 should be replaced by constanttemperature. A^ use of Universal Indicator with green asthe endpoint A^ use of litmus max 6
