**4** A student investigated the temperature changes when four different solids, **D** , **E** , **F** and **G** , reacted with excess dilute hydrochloric acid. The solids were all calcium compounds. 

 Four experiments were carried out. 

 (a) Experiment 1 

 Using a measuring cylinder, 30 cm 3 of hydrochloric acid was poured into a polystyrene cup. The temperature of the hydrochloric acid was measured. 2 g of solid D was added to the hydrochloric acid and the mixture stirred with a thermometer. The temperature reached by the liquid mixture was measured. Observations were recorded. 

 Observation: Rapid effervescence. 

 The polystyrene cup was emptied and rinsed with distilled water. 

 (b) Experiment 2 

 Experiment 1 was repeated using solid E. 

 (c) Experiment 3 

 Experiment 1 was repeated using solid F. 

 (d) Experiment 4 

 Experiment 1 was repeated using solid G but Universal Indicator solution was added to the hydrochloric acid before adding the solid. Observations were recorded. 

 Observation: The red colour of the liquid, pH 1, changed colour to orange then yellow, pH 6. 

 (e) Use the thermometer diagrams to record all of the temperatures in the table. Complete the final column in the table.

 Water was added to solid H to produce an aqueous solution, solution H. 

 (c) Drops of aqueous sodium hydroxide were added to 1 cm 3 of solution H and the test-tube shaken. 

 Excess sodium hydroxide was then added to the test-tube. 

 The mixture was heated gently and the gas given off was tested.

**6 Burnable Ice (Methane Hydrate)** 

 Methane hydrate is ice which contains trapped methane gas. Methane is released when the ice melts and is a useful fuel. Plan an investigation to find the volume of methane gas trapped in 1 kg of this ice. You are provided with a lump of the ice weighing between 100 g and 200 g and common laboratory apparatus. You may include a diagram in your answer.
