**4** A student investigated the reaction of aqueous sodium hydroxide with aqueous solutions of two different acids, **A** and **B**. Two experiments were done. **(a)** _Experiment 1_ Using a measuring cylinder, 50 cm 3 of aqueous sodium hydroxide solution was poured into a polystyrene cup. The initial temperature of the solution was measured. A burette was fi lled with the solution of acid **A** to the 0.0 cm^3 mark. 5.0 cm 3 of acid **A** was added to the aqueous sodium hydroxide in the cup and the mixture stirred. The temperature of the solution was measured. Another 5.0 cm 3 of acid **A** was added to the cup and the mixture stirred. The temperature of the mixture was measured. More 5.0 cm 3 portions of acid **A** were added to the cup until a total volume of 40.0 cm 3 of acid had been added. After each addition, the mixture was stirred and the temperature measured.

 The burette was emptied and rinsed with distilled water, and then with acid B. This acid was discarded. The burette was then fi lled up to the 0.0 cm 3 mark with acid B. (b) Experiment 2 Experiment 1 was repeated using acid B instead of acid A. Use the thermometer diagrams in the table to record the temperatures.

**6** A catalyst is a substance that speeds up the rate of a chemical reaction and remains unchanged at the end of the reaction. Hydrogen peroxide solution, H 2 O 2 , breaks down to form oxygen. This decomposition is very slow if a catalyst is not used. 

# Plan an investigation to show that copper(II) oxide is a suitable catalyst for this reaction. 

 You can use aqueous hydrogen peroxide and common laboratory apparatus. 

# Step 1 Show that copper(II) oxide catalyses the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and 

 measure the rate of the reaction. ........................................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................................... ...........................................................................................................................................................
