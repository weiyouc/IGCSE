# 2 A student prepared some crystals of chromium(III) nitrate, Cr(NO 3 ) 3 .6H 2 O. 

 The following extract was taken from his practical notes. 

# Making chromium(III ) nitrate crystals 

# Step 1 I poured 50 cm^3 of acid into a beaker. Solid chromium( III ) oxide was 

 then added a little at a time and the mixture stirred. 

# Step 2 When no more chromium(III ) oxide reacted I separated the mixture 

 and collected the solution in an evaporating dish. 

 Step 3 I boiled the solution strongly for ten minutes. 

 (a) Name the acid used in this preparation.

# (i) add the chromium(III) oxide to the acid,

**4** A student investigated the rate of reaction between hydrochloric acid and aqueous sodium thiosulfate. When these chemicals react they form a precipitate which makes the solution go cloudy. The formation of this precipitate can be used to show how fast the reaction proceeds. 

 Five experiments were done using the apparatus shown below. 

 aqueous sodium thiosulfate 

 eye 

 10 cm^3 of hydrochloric acid 

 250 cm^3 conical flask 

 printed sheet 

 (a) Experiment 1 

 Using a measuring cylinder, 50 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate was poured into a conical flask. The conical flask was placed on a printed sheet of paper. 10 cm 3 of the hydrochloric acid was added to the solution in the conical flask and the stop clock started. The time taken for the printed words to disappear from view was measured. 

 (b) Experiment 2 

 Using a measuring cylinder, 40 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate was poured into a conical flask, followed by 10 cm^3 of distilled water. The conical flask was placed on the printed sheet. 10 cm 3 of the hydrochloric acid was added to the solution in the conical flask and the stop clock started. The time taken for the printed words to disappear from view was measured. 

 (c) Experiment 3 

 Experiment 2 was repeated using 35 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate and 15 cm^3 of distilled water. 

 (d) Experiment 4 

 Experiment 2 was repeated using 30 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate and 20 cm^3 of distilled water. 

 (e) Experiment 5 

 Experiment 2 was repeated using 20 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate and 30 cm^3 of distilled water.

**7 Tonic Water** 

 Tonic water is a solution containing citric acid. The concentration of the acid can be determined by reaction with aqueous potassium hydroxide solution. Plan an investigation to show which of two different brands of colourless tonic water, Tastyton and Slimton, contains the highest concentration of citric acid. You can use common laboratory apparatus and chemicals.
