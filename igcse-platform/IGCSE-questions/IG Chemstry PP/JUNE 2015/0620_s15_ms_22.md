# CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL EXAMINATIONS Cambridge International General Certificate of Secondary Education MARK SCHEME for the May/June 2015 series 0620 CHEMISTRY 

## This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements ofthe examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does notindicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal ExaminerReport for Teachers.Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.^ 0620/22^ Paper 2 (Core Theory), maximum raw mark 80
