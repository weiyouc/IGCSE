**CHEMISTRY** Paper 5 Practical Test MARK SCHEMEMaximum Mark: 40 This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the **Cambridge International Examinations**^ Cambridge International General Certificate of Secondary Education (^) **Published March 20170620/52** examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate thedetails of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would haveconsidered the acceptability of alternative answers.Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report forTeachers.Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the March 2017 series for most Cambridge IGCSECambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components.® (^) ,

March 2017 Page 2 of 4 **Question**^ 

 Answer^ 

 Marks 1(b)^ initial and final readings completed correctly differences completed correctly^ all readings to 1 decimal place^ results comparable to the Supervisor’s results^ 1(c)^ blue to colourless^ 1(d)^ neutralisation^ 1(e)(i)^ solution^ O^ greater volume of acid was used in the titration^ 1(e)(ii)^ five times as concentrated^ 1(f)^ half volume^ /^ value from table for Experiment 2 

(^3) unit: cm 1(g)^ effect on volume: no effect^ reason: temperature would only affect the rate^ 1(h)(i)^ use a pipette^ /^ burette^ 1(h)(ii)^ repeat experiments(and compare^ /^ average)

 Answer^ 

 Marks 1(i)^ M1^ fair test^ to equal volumes of each sodium hydroxide solution 

 /^ solutions^ O^ and^ P^ add an equal volume^ /^ measured volumes of aqueous calcium chloride M2^ dependent variable measured measure mass^ /^ height of precipitate formed^ /^ volume of calcium chloride used M3^ conclusion the more concentrated sodium hydroxide solution would form the most precipitate (mass 

 /^ height)^ /^ would require a smaller volume of calcium chloride Question^
