**2** A student investigated the reaction between dilute hydrochloric acid and two different aqueous solutions of sodium hydroxide labelled solution **O** and solution **P**. 

 Two experiments were carried out. 

 Experiment 1 

 ● A burette was filled with dilute hydrochloric acid. The initial burette reading was recorded. ● Using a measuring cylinder, 20 cm^3 of solution O were poured into a conical flask. ● Thymolphthalein indicator was added to the conical flask. ● The dilute hydrochloric acid was added from the burette, while swirling the flask, until the solution just changed colour. The final burette reading was recorded. 

 (a) Use the burette diagrams to record the readings in the table and complete the table.

 Experiment 2 

 ● The conical flask was emptied and rinsed with distilled water. ● Experiment 1 was repeated using solution P instead of solution O. 

 (b) Use the burette diagrams to record the readings in the table and complete the table.

 (c) What type of chemical reaction occurs when dilute hydrochloric acid reacts with sodium hydroxide solution? 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [1] 

 (d) (i) Which solution of sodium hydroxide, solution O or solution P , is the more concentrated? Explain your answer. 

 ............................................................................................................................................. 

 ....................................................................................................................................... [2] 

 (ii) How many times more concentrated is this solution of sodium hydroxide than the other solution of sodium hydroxide? 

 ....................................................................................................................................... [1] 

 (e) If Experiment 2 were repeated using 10 cm^3 of solution P , what volume of dilute hydrochloric acid would be needed? 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [2] 

 (f) What would be the effect, if any, on the volume of dilute hydrochloric acid used in Experiment 1 if the solution of sodium hydroxide were warmed before adding the dilute hydrochloric acid? Give a reason for your answer. 

 effect on volume ........................................................................................................................ 

 reason ........................................................................................................................................ [2] 

 (g) (i) What would be a more accurate method of measuring the volume of the aqueous sodium hydroxide solution? 

 ....................................................................................................................................... [1] 

 (ii) Suggest how the reliability of the results could be checked. 

 ....................................................................................................................................... [1] 

 (h) Aqueous sodium hydroxide reacts with aqueous calcium chloride to form a precipitate of calcium hydroxide. 

 Use this information to suggest a different method of finding out which of the solutions of sodium hydroxide is the more concentrated.

**3** Two solids, **Q** and **R** , which are both salts, were analysed. Solid **Q** was zinc bromide. Tests were carried out on each solid. 

 tests on solid Q 

 Solid Q was dissolved in distilled water. The solution was divided into three equal portions in three test-tubes, and the following tests were carried out. 

 Complete the expected observations. 

 (a) (i) Drops of aqueous sodium hydroxide were added to the first portion of the solution until a change was seen.
