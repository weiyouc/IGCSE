**2** A student investigated the reaction between two different solutions, **A** and **B** , of aqueous 

# potassium manganate(VII) and solution C. 

 Three experiments were done. 

 Experiment 1 

 ● A burette was filled with solution A. The initial burette reading was recorded. ● A measuring cylinder was used to pour 25 cm^3 of solution C into a conical flask. ● Solution A was added to the conical flask until the mixture just turned pink. The final burette reading was recorded. ● About 2 cm^3 of the contents of the conical flask was poured into a test-tube to use in Experiment 3. ● The rest of the contents of the conical flask was poured away. The conical flask was rinsed with distilled water. 

 (a) Use the burette diagrams to record the burette readings in the table and complete the table.

 Experiment 2 

 ● The contents of the burette used in Experiment 1 were poured away and the burette was rinsed with distilled water. ● The burette was then rinsed with solution B. ● Experiment 1 was repeated using solution B instead of solution A.

**4** The rate of reaction between magnesium and dilute hydrochloric acid can be followed by measuring the volume of hydrogen produced. 

 Plan an experiment to investigate the effect of decreasing the temperature on the rate of this reaction by measuring the volume of hydrogen produced. 

 You are provided with magnesium ribbon, dilute hydrochloric acid and common laboratory apparatus. You are advised to draw a labelled diagram of the apparatus you would use in the space provided.
