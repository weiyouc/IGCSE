**1** Air is a mixture of gases. The diagram shows the apparatus used to find the percentage of oxygen in air. 50 cm 3 of air were passed backwards and forwards over excess heated copper until there was no further change. The apparatus was left to cool and the volume of gas remaining was 40 cm 3.

# 2 A student investigated what happens when dilute hydrochloric acid and copper(II) sulfate solution 

 react with different metals. 

 Five experiments were carried out. 

 (a) Experiment 1 

 A measuring cylinder was used to pour 10 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid into a boiling tube. The temperature of the hydrochloric acid was measured. 1 g of zinc was added to the boiling tube and the mixture stirred with a thermometer. The maximum temperature reached by the mixture was measured. 

 Experiment 2 

 Experiment 1 was repeated using 1 g of iron instead of zinc. 

 Experiment 3 

 Experiment 1 was repeated using 1 g of magnesium instead of zinc. 

 Use the thermometer diagrams to record the results in the table. Complete the final column in the table.

 (c) Experiment 4 

# A measuring cylinder was used to pour 10 cm^3 of copper(II) sulfate solution into a boiling tube. 

 The temperature of the solution was measured. 1 g of magnesium was added to the boiling tube and the mixture stirred with a thermometer. The maximum temperature reached by the mixture was measured. 

 Experiment 5 

 Experiment 4 was repeated using 1 g of iron instead of magnesium. The observation was recorded below.

**3** A mixture of two solids, **G** and **H** , was analysed. Solid **G** was zinc nitrate, which is water soluble, and solid **H** is insoluble in water. The tests on the mixture, and some of the observations, are shown. 

 Distilled water was added to the mixture in a boiling tube and shaken. The contents of the boiling tube were filtered keeping the filtrate and the residue. 

 tests on filtrate 

 (a) The filtrate was divided into four test-tubes and the following tests carried out. 

 (i) Drops of aqueous sodium hydroxide were added to the first portion of the solution. Excess aqueous sodium hydroxide was then added to the test-tube.

 A spatula was used to transfer some of the residue into a test-tube. 

 Dilute hydrochloric acid was added to the residue. The gas given off was tested.
