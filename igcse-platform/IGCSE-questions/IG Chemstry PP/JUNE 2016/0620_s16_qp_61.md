**2** A student investigated the reaction between aqueous sodium carbonate and two different solutions of dilute hydrochloric acid, **A** and **B**. The reaction is: 

 Na 2 CO3 (aq) + 2HC l (aq) → 2NaC l (aq) + H 2 O(l) + CO 2 (g) 

 Three experiments were carried out. 

 (a) Experiment 1 

 Using a measuring cylinder, 25 cm^3 of aqueous sodium carbonate were poured into a conical flask. Thymolphthalein indicator was added to the conical flask. A burette was filled up to the 0.0 cm^3 mark with solution A of dilute hydrochloric acid. A was added to the flask, until the solution just changed colour. Use the burette diagram to record the reading in the table.

 Experiment 2 

 Experiment 1 was repeated using methyl orange indicator instead of thymolphthalein. Methyl orange is red-orange in acidic solutions and yellow in alkaline solutions. Use the burette diagrams to record the readings in the table and complete the table.

**3** Two substances, **C** and **D** , were analysed. Solid **C** was a salt and solution **D** was an aqueous 

# solution of chromium(III) chloride. 

 The tests on solid C , and some of the observations, are in the following table. 

 tests observations 

 tests on solid C 

 Solid C was added to distilled water in a test-tube and shaken to dissolve. 

 The solution was divided into two portions in test-tubes, and the following tests carried out. 

 Appearance of the solution. 

 The pH of the first portion of the solution was tested. 

 colourless liquid 

 pH = 7 

 Dilute nitric acid was added to the second portion of the solution followed by aqueous silver nitrate.

**4** Calcium burns in air to form calcium oxide. The reaction is vigorous and some of the calcium oxide can be lost as smoke. Plan an investigation to determine the maximum mass of oxygen that combines to form calcium oxide when 2 g of calcium granules are burnt in air. You are provided with common laboratory apparatus and calcium granules.
