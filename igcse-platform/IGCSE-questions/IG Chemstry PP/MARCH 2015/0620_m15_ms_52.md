## MARK SCHEME for the March 2015 series 

# 0620 CHEMISTRY 

## 0620/52 Paper 5 (Practical), maximum raw mark 40 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. 

Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the March 2015 series for most Cambridge IGCSE® components.

1 (d) Table of results 

 total volume of water boxes completed correctly (1), 

 10, 12, 14, 18 

 temperature boxes completed (1) 

 values decreasing (1) 

 comparable to supervisor’s results (2) ± 10 °C [5] 

 (e) appropriate scale for y axis (1) note: must use at least 4 large squares vertically to plot points 

 all points correctly plotted (3), all 4 correct (3) 3 correct (2) 2 correct (1) 1 or fewer correct (0) note: origin should not be included 

 smooth line graph (1) [5] 

 (f) value from graph for 20 cm^3 water (1) ± half a small square 

 shown clearly by extrapolation(1) [2] 

 (g) clear / colourless liquid forms / no solid / crystals / salt visible owtte (1) [1] 

 (h) salt would not all dissolve (1) 

 use of figures (1) e.g. only 5.7 g would dissolve in 10 cm^3 water at 100 °C [2]

 Cambridge IGCSE – March 2015 0620 52 

 (j) any one improvement from: (1) 

 do not remove thermometer from solution use IT method / second person to note formation of crystals repeat do separate experiments use smaller volumes of water loss of water through boiling/evaporation 

 linked explanation (1) 

 loss of solid on thermometer observing formation of first crystals may vary average more results to plot on graph method of avoiding evaporation [2]
