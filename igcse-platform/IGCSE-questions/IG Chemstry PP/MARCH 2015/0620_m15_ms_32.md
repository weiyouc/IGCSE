## MARK SCHEME for the March 2015 series 

# 0620 CHEMISTRY 

## 0620/32 Paper 3 (Extended Theory), maximum raw mark 80 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements ofthe examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal ExaminerReport for Teachers. 

Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the March 2015 series for most Cambridge IGCSE components. ®
