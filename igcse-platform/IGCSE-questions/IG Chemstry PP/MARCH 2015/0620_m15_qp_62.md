**4** A student investigated the solubility of salt **D** in water at various temperatures. Four experiments were carried out. **(a)** _Experiment 1_ 4 g of salt **D** was added to a boiling tube. A burette was filled with distilled water and 10.0 cm 3 of water added to the boiling tube. The mixture of salt **D** and water was heated carefully until all of the solid had dissolved. The boiling tube was removed from the heat and the solution allowed to cool. The solution was stirred gently with a thermometer. The temperature at which crystals first appeared was noted. The boiling tube and its contents were kept for the remaining three experiments. **(b)** _Experiment 2_ From the burette another 2.0 cm 3 of water was added to the boiling tube and contents from Experiment 1. The mixture was heated to dissolve the crystals and allowed to cool as in Experiment 1. The temperature at which crystals first appeared was noted. Record, in the table, the total volume of water in the boiling tube. **(c)** _Experiment 3_ From the burette another 2.0 cm 3 of water was added to the boiling tube and contents from Experiment 2. The experiment was repeated exactly as before. Record, in the table, the total volume of water in the boiling tube.

 (d) Experiment 4 From the burette another 4.0 cm 3 of water was added to the boiling tube and contents from Experiment 3. The experiment was repeated exactly as before. Record in the table the total volume of water in the boiling tube. Use the thermometer diagrams in the table to record the temperatures at which crystals first appeared in the four experiments.

 (h) The solubility of salt D at 100 °C is 57 g in 100 cm 3 of water.

**5** Two metal salt solutions, **E** and **F** , were analysed. 

# E was a mixture of iron(II) sulfate and ammonium sulfate.

**6 Rhubarb Leaves** 

 Ethanedioic acid dihydrate, H 2 C 2 O 4 .2H 2 O, is a white crystalline solid. This acid is water-soluble and is found in rhubarb leaves. Plan an investigation to obtain crystals of ethanedioic acid dihydrate from some rhubarb leaves. You are provided with common laboratory apparatus, water and sand. ........................................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................................... .....................................................................................................................................................
