**CHEMISTRY** Paper 6 Alternative to Practical MARK SCHEMEMaximum Mark: 40 **Cambridge Assessment International Education**^ Cambridge International General Certificate of Secondary Education **October/November 20170620/63** This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of theexamination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate thedetails of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would haveconsidered the acceptability of alternative answers.Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report forTeachers.Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.^ **Published**

 Answer^ 

 Marks 

 2(d)(ii)^ value from graph^ shown clearly^ 2(e)^ exothermic^ 2(f)^ room temperature / 22 

 °C AND reaction has finished / all the solid has dissolved 2(g)^ source of error^ 

 improvement heat losses^ 

 use a lid^ /^ lag the apparatus use of a measuring cylinder^ 

 use a pipette/burette wet cup in the second experiment 

 use new/another cup 

 OR^ dry the cup the solid absorbs water from the air 

 store in a sealed container / airtight container / desiccator only done once repeat 

 and^ average different masses of solids used / masses ofsolids not measured 

 use same mass of solid / weigh the solids 2(h)^ fewer data^ /^ less detail 

 /^ fewer readings^ /^ graph not as good 

 /^ not enough readings whilst the solid is reacting
