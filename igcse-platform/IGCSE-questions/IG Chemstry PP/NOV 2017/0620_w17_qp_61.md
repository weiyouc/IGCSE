**2** A student investigated the rate of reaction between dilute hydrochloric acid and aqueous sodium thiosulfate. When these chemicals react they form a precipitate which makes the solution go cloudy. The formation of this precipitate can be used to show how fast the reaction proceeds. 

 Five experiments were carried out using the apparatus shown.

 250 cm^3 conical flask 

 sheet of paper with words printed on it 

 Experiment 1 

 ● Using a measuring cylinder, 50 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate were poured into a conical flask. The initial temperature of the solution was measured. The conical flask was placed on a sheet of paper with words printed on it. ● Using a measuring cylinder, 10 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid were added to the solution in the conical flask and a stopclock was started. ● The time taken for the printed words to disappear from view was measured. ● The final temperature of the mixture was measured. 

 Experiment 2 

 ● Using a measuring cylinder, 50 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate were poured into a conical flask. The solution was heated to about 30 ° C and the temperature was measured. The conical flask was placed on a sheet of paper with words printed on it. ● Using a measuring cylinder, 10 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid were added to the solution in the conical flask and a stopclock was started. ● The time taken for the printed words to disappear from view was measured. ● The final temperature of the mixture was measured. 

 Experiment 3 

 ● Experiment 2 was repeated but the 50 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate were heated to about 40 ° C before adding the dilute hydrochloric acid. 

 Experiment 4 

 ● Experiment 2 was repeated but the 50 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate were heated to about 50 ° C before adding the dilute hydrochloric acid. 

 Experiment 5 

 ● Experiment 2 was repeated but the 50 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate were heated to about 60 ° C before adding the dilute hydrochloric acid.
