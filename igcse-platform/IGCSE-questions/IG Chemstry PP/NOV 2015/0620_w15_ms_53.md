## This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements ofthe examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does notindicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal ExaminerReport for Teachers.Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2015 series for most^ 0620/53^ Paper 5 (Practical), maximum raw mark 40

### 1 

 1(c)(ii)^ to remove water^ /^ so^ N^ is not diluted; 

 1 R:^ N^ reacts with water 1(d)(i)^ colourless^ /^ pale green to pink; 

 1 R:^ clear to pink^ I:^ red 1(d)(ii)^ there is already a colour change

 1(e)(i)^ Experiment 1^ /^ solution^ M^ 

### 1 

 1(e)(ii)^ volume for Experiment 1 is twice volume for Experiment 2 

### / 

 volume for Experiment 2 is half volume for Experiment 1; 

### 1 

 1(e)(iii)^ solution^ N^ is twice as concentrated 

 /^ strong ora;^ 

 2 A:^ solution^ N^ is more concentrated 

 /^ stronger ora = [1]
