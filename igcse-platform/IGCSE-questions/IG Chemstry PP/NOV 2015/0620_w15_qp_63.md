**3** A student investigated the temperature changes when dilute nitric acid reacted with aqueous potassium hydroxide. Solution **C** was nitric acid and solution **D** was aqueous potassium hydroxide. She mixed together different volumes of **C** and **D** in four experiments. The maximum temperature reached was measured in each experiment. 

 The initial temperature of the solutions was 25 °C. 

 (a) Use the thermometer diagrams in the table to record the maximum temperatures. Work out the rise in temperature in each experiment.

# 4 A student investigated the reaction between an acidic solution of iron(II) sulfate, solution L , and two 

# different solutions of aqueous potassium manganate(VII), solutions M and N. 

 Three experiments were carried out. 

 (a) Experiment 1 

 Excess aqueous sodium hydroxide was added to about 3 cm 3 of solution L in a test-tube. 

 What observations would be expected in Experiment 1? 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [2] 

 (b) Experiment 2 

# A burette was filled with the solution M of potassium manganate(VII) to the 0.0 cm^3 mark. 

 Using a measuring cylinder, 25 cm 3 of solution L was poured into a conical flask. 

 Solution M was added to the flask until the mixture just turned permanently pink. 

 Use the burette diagram to record the readings in the table and complete the table.

 (c) Experiment 3 

 The burette was emptied and rinsed thoroughly with distilled water. A small volume of the 

# solution N of aqueous potassium manganate(VII) was added to the burette and shaken. 

 This solution was discarded. 

# Solution N of potassium manganate(VII) was then poured into the burette. 

 Experiment 1 was repeated using solution N instead of solution M. 

 Use the burette diagrams to record readings in the table and complete the table.

**6** Dilute sulfuric acid reacts rapidly with magnesium ribbon. The magnesium ribbon gets smaller and eventually disappears. 

 Plan an investigation to show how the rate of this reaction changes using different concentrations of sulfuric acid. You are provided with common laboratory apparatus, sulfuric acid, water and magnesium ribbon.
