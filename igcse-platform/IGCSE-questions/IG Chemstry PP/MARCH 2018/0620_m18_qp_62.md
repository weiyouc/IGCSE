**2** A student investigated the reaction between dilute hydrochloric acid and an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate labelled solution **L**. 

 Three experiments were done. 

 Experiment 1 

 ● A measuring cylinder was used to pour 25 cm^3 of solution L into a conical flask. ● Ten drops of thymolphthalein indicator were added to the conical flask. ● A burette was filled up to the 0.0 cm^3 mark with dilute hydrochloric acid. ● Dilute hydrochloric acid was added from the burette to the conical flask until the solution just changed to colourless at the end-point of the titration. 

 (a) Use the burette diagram to record the final burette reading in the table and complete the table.

 Experiment 2 

 ● Ten drops of methyl orange indicator were added to the solution in the conical flask from Experiment 1. ● Dilute hydrochloric acid was added from the burette to the conical flask until the solution just changed colour. 

 (b) Use the burette diagram to record the final burette reading in the table and complete the table.

 Experiment 3 

 ● The conical flask was emptied and rinsed with distilled water. ● Experiment 1 was repeated using methyl orange indicator instead of thymolphthalein indicator and adding dilute hydrochloric acid from the burette to the conical flask until the solution just changed colour. 

 (c) Use the burette diagrams to record the burette readings in the table and complete the table.
