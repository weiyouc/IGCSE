It does not indicate thedetails of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would haveconsidered the acceptability of alternative answers.Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report forTeachers.Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2016 series for mostCambridge IGCSEcomponents. ® (^) , Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level

## ORA^ 

 5(a)(ii)(no) the melting point range does not increase regularly 

 /^ the melting point range goes up and down 

 /^ the melting point range remains fairly constant OR (yes) the more carbon, the greater the melting point range 

 /^ the difference between the higher and lower number is greater with more carbon OR (yes) the average melting point range is higher the more carbon (except for 

 D )^ /^ the general trend is for a higher melting point range with more carbon 5(a)(iii)^ D^ because it is resistant to corrosion 5(b)^ A^ 5(c)(i)^ gives strength^ /^ so the wire does not break 

 /^ so the wire does not sag^ /^ for support 5(c)(ii)^ use:^ any suitable use, e.g. food container
