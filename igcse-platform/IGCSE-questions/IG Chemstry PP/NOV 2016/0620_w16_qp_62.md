**2** A student investigated the rate of reaction between dilute hydrochloric acid and excess magnesium at room temperature. The apparatus was set up as shown in the diagram. 

 water 

 magnesium ribbon 

 measuring cylinder 

 dilute hydrochloric acid 

 30 cm 3 of dilute hydrochloric acid were added to the conical flask containing magnesium ribbon. The timer was then started and the volume of gas collected in the measuring cylinder was measured every 20 seconds for 180 seconds (3 minutes).
