**2** A student investigated what happened when dilute nitric acid reacted with aqueous solutions of two different alkalis, solution **N** and solution **O**. 

 Two experiments were carried out. 

 (a) Experiment 1 

 A measuring cylinder was used to pour 50 cm^3 of solution N into a polystyrene cup. The initial temperature of the solution was measured. A burette was filled with nitric acid to the 0.0 cm^3 mark. 5.0 cm 3 of nitric acid were added to solution N in the polystyrene cup and the solution stirred. The maximum temperature of the solution was measured. A further 5.0 cm 3 of nitric acid were added to the polystyrene cup and the solution stirred. The maximum temperature of the solution was measured. The student continued to add 5.0 cm 3 portions of nitric acid to the polystyrene cup, until a total volume of 40 cm 3 of nitric acid had been added. After each addition, the solution was stirred and the maximum temperature measured.
