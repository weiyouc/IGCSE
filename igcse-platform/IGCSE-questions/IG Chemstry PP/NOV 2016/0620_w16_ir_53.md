 READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST 

 The teacher responsible for preparing the examination is not allowed to consult the question paper before the examination. Teachers should, as part of the preparation of the examination requirements, carry out any tests indicated on pages 2 and 3 in order to satisfy themselves that the supplied materials are satisfactory. 

 The standard Report Form to be included with the scripts is given on pages 7 and 8. Please detach and enclose it with the scripts. If scripts are despatched in more than one envelope, it is essential that a copy of the Supervisor’s Results and of the Report Form are sent inside each envelope. 

 More material may be issued if required, without penalty, but this should not be necessary. 

 Supervisors are advised to remind candidates that all substances in the examination should be treated with caution. Safety glasses should be provided. 

 In accordance with COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) Regulations, operative in the UK, a hazard appraisal of the examination has been carried out. 

 Attention is drawn, in particular, to certain materials used in the examination. The following codes are used where relevant. 

 C = corrosive MH = moderate hazard 

 HH = health hazard T = acutely toxic 

 F = flammable O = oxidising 

 N = hazardous to the aquatic environment 

 Hazard data sheets should be available from your suppliers. 

 If you have any queries regarding these Instructions, please contact CIE by email: info@cie.org.uk, by phone: +44 1223 553554, by fax: +44 1223 553558, stating the Centre number, the nature of the query and the syllabus number quoted above.

 REPORT ON PRACTICAL CHEMISTRY 

**1 (a)** Supervisor’s Results 

 It is recommended that the Supervisor should be a chemistry teacher. 

 The Supervisor is asked to carry out the experiments in Questions 1 and 2 and to record the results on a spare copy of the Question Paper clearly labelled ‘Supervisor’s Results’. Failure to enclose these results and this report form may lead to candidates being unavoidably penalised. 

 (b) The candidate numbers of candidates in each session were:
