 2 A student investigated what happened when two different metals, iron and magnesium, reacted 

# with aqueous copper(II) sulfate. 

 Two experiments were carried out. 

 (a) Experiment 1 

# A measuring cylinder was used to pour 25 cm^3 of aqueous copper(II) sulfate into a polystyrene 

 cup. The initial temperature of the solution was measured, then again at 30 seconds and at 60 seconds. 

# At 60 seconds, the iron was added to the aqueous copper(II) sulfate and the mixture stirred 

 continuously with a thermometer. The temperature of the mixture was measured every 30 seconds for 300 seconds (5 minutes). Use the thermometer diagrams to record the results in the table.
