 2 A student investigated the reaction between aqueous sodium carbonate and aqueous barium nitrate. 

 ● A burette was filled with aqueous sodium carbonate. ● Seven test-tubes were labelled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. ● A measuring cylinder was used to pour 6 cm^3 of aqueous barium nitrate into each of the seven test-tubes in a test-tube rack. ● 1.0 cm^3 of aqueous sodium carbonate was added from the burette to test-tube 1. ● 2.0 cm^3 of aqueous sodium carbonate was added from the burette to test-tube 2. ● 4.0 cm^3 of aqueous sodium carbonate was added from the burette to test-tube 3. ● 5.0 cm^3 of aqueous sodium carbonate was added from the burette to test-tube 4. ● 6.0 cm^3 of aqueous sodium carbonate was added from the burette to test-tube 5. ● 7.0 cm^3 of aqueous sodium carbonate was added from the burette to test-tube 6. ● 8.0 cm^3 of aqueous sodium carbonate was added from the burette to test-tube 7. 

 A glass rod was used to stir the contents of each of the test-tubes. The contents of the test-tubes were left to stand until the solid formed had settled. A ruler was used to measure the height of the solid formed in each test-tube. 

 (a) Use a ruler to measure the heights of the solid formed in each test-tube shown in the diagram. Record the heights of the solid formed in the table and complete the table.

 (e) Predict what would happen if the experiment were continued using three further test-tubes each containing 6 cm^3 of aqueous barium nitrate and separately adding 9.0 cm^3 , 10.0 cm 3 and 11.0 cm 3 of aqueous sodium carbonate to each one. Explain your answer.

**4** Steel nails rust in the presence of air and water. Plan an investigation to: 

 ● show that coating steel nails with paint helps to protect the nails from rusting ● show that coating steel nails with zinc helps to protect the nails from rusting ● determine which coating is more effective at protecting steel nails from rusting. 

 You are provided with: 

 ● uncoated steel nails ● steel nails coated with paint ● steel nails coated with zinc ● common laboratory apparatus.
