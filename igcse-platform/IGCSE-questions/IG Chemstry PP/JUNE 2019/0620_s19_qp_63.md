**2** A student investigated the temperature changes when two different metals, zinc and magnesium, 

# reacted with aqueous copper(II) sulfate. 

 Three experiments were done. 

 Experiment 1 

# ● A measuring cylinder was used to pour 25 cm^3 aqueous copper(II) sulfate into a polystyrene 

 cup. ● The initial temperature of the solution was measured and the timer was started. ● The temperature of the solution was measured at 30 seconds and at 60 seconds. 

# ● At 60 seconds, 5 g of zinc powder was added to the aqueous copper(II) sulfate. The mixture 

 was stirred with a thermometer. ● The temperature of the mixture was measured every 30 seconds for 210 seconds. The mixture was stirred continuously.

**3** Two substances, solid **N** and solid **O** were analysed. Solid **N** was hydrated aluminium sulfate. Tests were done on solid **N** and solid **O**. 

 tests on solid N 

 Complete the expected observations. 

 (a) Describe the appearance of solid N. 

 observation .......................................................................................................................... [1] 

 Solid N was divided into two portions. 

 (b) The first portion of solid N was heated in a hard-glass test-tube. Any gas produced was tested 

# with cobalt(II) chloride paper.
