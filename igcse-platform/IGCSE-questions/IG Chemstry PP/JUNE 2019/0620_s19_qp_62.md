**1** A student did the following steps to make zinc chloride crystals from solid zinc oxide. 

 step 1 Pour 40 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid into a beaker. Add a small amount of zinc oxide. Warm the mixture and stir it. step 2 Continue to add zinc oxide to the beaker until all of the dilute hydrochloric acid has reacted. step 3 Remove the excess zinc oxide. step 4 Obtain crystals of zinc chloride from the solution. 

 (a) Name the apparatus used in step 1 to: 

 (i) add the zinc oxide

 2 A student investigated the rate of reaction between magnesium ribbon and solutions of dilute hydrochloric acid of different concentrations, solutions H , I , J and K. The dilute hydrochloric acid was in excess in all experiments. 

 Five experiments were done. 

 Experiment 1 ● A measuring cylinder was used to pour 30 cm^3 of solution H into a beaker. ● A 5.0 cm length of magnesium ribbon was then added to the beaker. ● A timer was started immediately. ● The time taken for all of the magnesium ribbon to react and to disappear completely was measured. 

 Experiment 2 ● Experiment 1 was repeated but using solution I instead of solution H. 

 Experiment 3 ● Experiment 1 was repeated but using solution J instead of solution H. 

 Experiment 4 ● Experiment 1 was repeated but using solution K instead of solution H. 

 (a) Use the stop-clock diagrams to record the time taken for each experiment in the table.

 Complete the expected observations. 

 (a) Describe the appearance of solid L. 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [1] 

 Solid L was divided into two portions.
