**1** You are going to investigate the rate of reaction between magnesium ribbon and solutions of dilute hydrochloric acid of different concentrations, solutions **H** , **I** , **J** and **K**. The dilute hydrochloric acid is in excess in all experiments. 

 Read all the instructions carefully before starting the experiments. 

 Instructions You are going to do five experiments. 

 Experiment 1 ● Use the 50 cm^3 measuring cylinder to pour 30 cm^3 of solution H into the beaker. ● Add a 5.0 cm length of magnesium ribbon to solution H in the beaker and start the timer immediately. Stir the mixture constantly. ● Measure the time taken for all of the magnesium ribbon to react and to disappear completely. ● Record the time taken in the table. ● Rinse out the beaker with distilled water. 

 Experiment 2 ● Repeat Experiment 1 but use solution I instead of solution H. Record the time taken in the table. 

 Experiment 3 ● Repeat Experiment 1 but use solution J instead of solution H. Record the time taken in the table. 

 Experiment 4 ● Repeat Experiment 1 but use solution K instead of solution H. Record the time taken in the table. 

 (a) Record your results from Experiments 1–4 in the table.

 (b) Experiment 5 Add about 3 cm 3 of solution J to a 5.0 cm length of magnesium ribbon in a test-tube. Test the gas produced with a lighted splint. Record your observations.

 Question 2 starts on the next page. 


**2** You are provided with solid **L** , which contains two cations and one anion. Do the following tests on solid **L** , recording all of your observations at each stage. 

 tests on solid L 

 (a) Describe the appearance of solid L. 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [1] 

 Use a spatula to divide solid L into two approximately equal portions. 

 (b) Heat the first portion of solid L in a hard-glass test-tube. Test any gas produced with blue 

# cobalt(II) chloride paper. 

 Record your observations. 

 .................................................................................................................................................... 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [3] 

 Add the second portion of solid L to about 10 cm^3 of distilled water in a boiling tube. Stopper the boiling tube and shake the mixture to dissolve solid L and form solution L. Divide solution L into five approximately equal portions in five test-tubes. 

 (c) Test the pH of the first portion of solution L. 

 pH = ............................... [1] 

 (d) (i) Transfer the second portion of solution L into a boiling tube. Add about 3 cm^3 of aqueous sodium hydroxide. Record your observations.

# 3 Azurite is an ore of copper which contains copper(II) carbonate. Azurite contains no other metal 

 ions. 

 Plan an experiment to show how a sample of copper could be obtained from large lumps of azurite. 

 Your answer should include: 

 ● descriptions of the reactions involved ● the expected observations. 

 You are provided with a large lump of azurite and common laboratory chemicals and apparatus.
