**1** A sample of rock salt contains sodium chloride and sand. 

 Sodium chloride is soluble in water. Sand is insoluble in water. 

 A student obtained dry crystals of pure sodium chloride from a lump of rock salt. These are some of the steps the student used. 

 step 1 step 2 step 3 

 grind the rock salt into smaller pieces 

 add the rock salt to water and heat while stirring with a glass rod

**2** A student investigated the temperature change when aqueous sodium hydroxide neutralises dilute hydrochloric acid. The equation for the reaction is shown. 

 NaOH + HC l → NaC l + H 2 O 

 Eight experiments were done. 

 Experiment 1 ● A polystyrene cup was placed into a 250 cm^3 beaker for support. ● Using a measuring cylinder, 5 cm 3 of aqueous sodium hydroxide was poured into the polystyrene cup. ● Using a measuring cylinder, 45 cm 3 of dilute hydrochloric acid was poured into the polystyrene cup. ● The mixture was stirred and the maximum temperature reached was measured using a thermometer. ● The polystyrene cup was rinsed with distilled water. 

 Experiment 2 ● Experiment 1 was repeated using 10 cm^3 of aqueous sodium hydroxide and 40 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid. 

 Experiment 3 ● Experiment 1 was repeated using 15 cm^3 of aqueous sodium hydroxide and 35 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid. 

 Experiment 4 ● Experiment 1 was repeated using 20 cm^3 of aqueous sodium hydroxide and 30 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid. 

 Experiment 5 ● Experiment 1 was repeated using 30 cm^3 of aqueous sodium hydroxide and 20 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid. 

 Experiment 6 ● Experiment 1 was repeated using 35 cm^3 of aqueous sodium hydroxide and 15 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid. 

 Experiment 7 ● Experiment 1 was repeated using 40 cm^3 of aqueous sodium hydroxide and 10 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid. 

 Experiment 8 ● Experiment 1 was repeated using 45 cm^3 of aqueous sodium hydroxide and 5 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid.

 (c) The point on the graph where the two straight lines cross is where all of the aqueous sodium hydroxide reacts with all of the dilute hydrochloric acid to form a neutral solution. 

 (i) Use your graph to deduce the volume of aqueous sodium hydroxide and the volume of dilute hydrochloric acid that react together to produce a neutral solution. Show your working on the grid. 

 volume of aqueous sodium hydroxide = .............................. cm^3 

 volume of dilute hydrochloric acid = .............................. cm^3 [3] 

 (ii) Use your graph to determine the highest temperature reached if the volumes in (c)(i) were mixed together.

**3** Two solids, solid **N** and solid **P** , were analysed. Tests were done on each solid. 

 tests on solid N 

 Tests were done and the following observations made. 

 tests on solid N observations 

 Solid N was dissolved in distilled water to produce solution N. The solution was divided into three equal portions in three boiling tubes. 

 test 1 

 Aqueous sodium hydroxide was added slowly until in excess to the first portion of solution N. 

 white precipitate formed, the precipitate dissolved in excess aqueous sodium hydroxide forming a colourless solution 

 test 2 

 Aqueous ammonia was added slowly until in excess to the second portion of solution N. 

 white precipitate formed, the precipitate dissolved in excess aqueous ammonia forming a colourless solution 

 test 3 

 Aluminium foil and aqueous sodium hydroxide were added to the third portion of solution N. The mixture was heated using a Bunsen burner. Any gas produced was tested with damp red litmus paper. 

 effervescence was seen, the damp red litmus paper turned blue

**4** Stayclean and Brightwhite are two brands of washing powder. Both contain sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonate is soluble in water and reacts with dilute sulfuric acid to produce carbon dioxide gas. 

 Plan an investigation to determine which of the two washing powders, Stayclean or Brightwhite, contains the greatest percentage of sodium carbonate. 

 You are provided with samples of the two washing powders and common laboratory apparatus and chemicals.
