**2** A student investigated the rate of reaction between magnesium ribbon and two different solutions of dilute sulfuric acid, solution **G** and solution **H**. The acid was in excess in both experiments. 

 Two experiments were carried out. 

 Experiment 1 

 ● The apparatus was set up as shown in the diagram. 

 trough 

 water 

 conical flask 

 bung 

 rubber connector 

 inverted 100 cm^3 measuring cylinder 

 clamp 

 ● Using a measuring cylinder, 50 cm^3 of solution G were poured into the conical flask. A piece of magnesium ribbon was added to the conical flask and the bung replaced. ● The timer was started immediately and the total volume of gas collected in the measuring cylinder was measured every 20 seconds for 180 seconds (3 minutes). 

 Experiment 2 

 ● Experiment 1 was repeated using 50 cm^3 of solution H instead of solution G.

 tests on solid J 

 Appearance of solid J. black solid 

 test 1 

 Dilute hydrochloric acid was added to solid J. The mixture was heated and the gas given off was tested with damp litmus paper. 

 blue litmus turned white 

 tests on solution K 

 Solution K was divided into two equal portions in two test-tubes. 

 test 2 

# Iron(II) sulfate crystals were added to the first 

 portion of the solution. The mixture was shaken and aqueous sodium hydroxide was added to the mixture. 

 red-brown precipitate formed 

 test 3 

 Solid J was added to the second portion of the solution. The gas given off was tested with a splint.
