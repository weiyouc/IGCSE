**1** You are going to investigate the time taken to collect 40 cm^3 of hydrogen gas when magnesium reacts with dilute sulfuric acid. 

 Read all of the instructions carefully before starting the experiments. 

 Instructions You are going to do five experiments using the apparatus shown. 

 water 

 inverted 50 cm^3 measuring cylinder 

 dilute sulfuric acid and distilled water 

 Experiment 1 ● Use the 10 cm^3 measuring cylinder to pour 8 cm^3 of dilute sulfuric acid into the boiling tube. ● Use the 25 cm 3 measuring cylinder to pour 12 cm^3 of distilled water into the boiling tube. ● Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram, ensuring the inverted measuring cylinder is full of water. ● Remove the bung from the boiling tube. ● Add a coiled length of magnesium ribbon to the boiling tube, immediately replace the bung and start the timer. ● Measure the time taken for 40 cm^3 of gas to be collected. Record the time to the nearest second in the table in (b). ● Feel the outside of the boiling tube. 

 (a) (i) What happens to the temperature of the contents of the boiling tube during the reaction? 

 ....................................................................................................................................... [1] 

 (ii) What does your answer to (a)(i) tell you about the type of reaction? 

 ....................................................................................................................................... [1] 

 (iii) Describe one change that could be made to the apparatus to help keep the temperature of the contents of the boiling tube constant during the reaction. 

 ....................................................................................................................................... [1] 


**©UCLES 2020 0620/52/F/M/20** 

 Experiment 2 ● Rinse out the boiling tube with distilled water. ● Use a measuring cylinder to pour 10 cm^3 of dilute sulfuric acid and 10 cm^3 of distilled water into the boiling tube. ● Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram, ensuring the inverted measuring cylinder is full of water. ● Remove the bung from the boiling tube. ● Add a coiled length of magnesium ribbon to the boiling tube, immediately replace the bung and start the timer. ● Measure the time taken for 40 cm 3 of gas to be collected. Record the time to the nearest second in the table in (b). 

 Experiment 3 ● Repeat Experiment 2 using the 25 cm^3 measuring cylinder to pour 12 cm^3 of dilute sulfuric acid into the boiling tube. Use the 10 cm 3 measuring cylinder to pour 8 cm^3 of distilled water into the boiling tube. 

 Experiment 4 ● Repeat Experiment 3 using 16 cm^3 of dilute sulfuric acid and 4 cm 3 of distilled water. 

 Experiment 5 ● Repeat Experiment 3 using 20 cm^3 of dilute sulfuric acid and no distilled water. 

 (b) Complete the table.

 (d) (i) From your graph , deduce the time taken to collect 40 cm^3 of gas if the experiment was repeated using 9 cm^3 of dilute sulfuric acid. 

 Show clearly on the grid how you worked out your answer.

 (e) The rate of reaction can be calculated using the equation shown. 

 rate of reaction = 

 volume of gas collected time taken to collect the gas 

 (i) Use this equation to calculate the rate of reaction in Experiment 1. Give the units for the rate of reaction you have calculated. 

 rate of reaction = .............................. units = .............................. [2] 

 (ii) In which Experiment, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, was the rate of reaction greatest? 

 ....................................................................................................................................... [1] 

 (f) Why would measuring the volume of dilute sulfuric acid with a burette rather than a measuring cylinder be an improvement? 

 .................................................................................................................................................... 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [1] 

 (g) The magnesium starts to react with the dilute sulfuric acid as soon as it is added. 

 (i) Why does this decrease the accuracy of the investigation?

**2** You are provided with two substances, solution **J** and solid **K**. Do the following tests on solution **J** and solid **K** , recording all of your observations at each stage. 

 tests on solution J 

 Divide solution J into four approximately equal portions in four test-tubes. You will need to keep one portion for the tests on solid K. 

 (a) Describe the appearance of solution J.
