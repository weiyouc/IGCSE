**1** You are going to investigate the rate of reaction between dilute hydrochloric acid and aqueous sodium thiosulfate. When these chemicals react they form a precipitate which makes the solution go cloudy. The formation of this precipitate can be used to show how fast the reaction proceeds. 

 Read all the instructions carefully before starting the experiments. 

 Instructions You are going to do five experiments using the apparatus shown. 

 aqueous sodium thiosulfate 

 eye 

 10 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid 

 250 cm^3 conical flask 

 printed insert 

 printed words 

 Experiment 1 

 ● Use the large measuring cylinder to pour 50 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate into the conical flask. Place the conical flask on the printed insert. ● Fill the small measuring cylinder with 10 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid. ● Add the dilute hydrochloric acid to the solution in the conical flask. Start the timer immediately and swirl the mixture. ● View the conical flask from above and measure the time taken for the printed words to disappear from view. Record the time taken in the table on page 4. ● Immediately pour the contents of the conical flask into the quenching bath and rinse the conical flask with distilled water. 

 Experiment 2 

 ● Use the large measuring cylinder to pour 40 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate into the conical flask, followed by 10 cm^3 of distilled water. Place the conical flask on the printed insert. ● Fill the small measuring cylinder with 10 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid. ● Add the dilute hydrochloric acid to the solution in the conical flask. Start the timer immediately and swirl the mixture. ● View the conical flask from above and measure the time taken for the printed words to disappear from view. Record the time taken in the table on page 4. ● Immediately pour the contents of the conical flask into the quenching bath and rinse the conical flask with distilled water.

 Experiment 3 

 ● Repeat Experiment 2 but use 35 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate, 15 cm^3 of distilled water and 10 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid. 

 Experiment 4 

 ● Repeat Experiment 2 but use 30 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate, 20 cm^3 of distilled water and 10 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid. 

 Experiment 5 

 ● Repeat Experiment 2 but use 10 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate, 40 cm^3 of distilled water and 10 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid.
