**2** A student investigated the temperature changes when two different solids, solid **C** and solid **D** , dissolved in water. 

 Two experiments were done. 

 Experiment 1 

 ● Using a measuring cylinder, 40 cm^3 of distilled water was poured into a polystyrene cup. The initial temperature of the distilled water was measured. ● 3 g of solid C was added to the polystyrene cup and the mixture was stirred with a thermometer. The temperature of the solution was measured after 1 minute. 

 ● The procedure was repeated using 4 g of solid C. ● The procedure was repeated using 6 g of solid C. 

 (a) Use the thermometer diagrams to record the results in the table. 

 Calculate and record the temperature change in each case, including whether the temperature increased (+) or decreased (–).

 Experiment 2 

 ● Experiment 1 was repeated but using 3 g, 4 g, 6 g and 8 g of solid D. 

 (b) Use the thermometer diagrams to record the results in the table. 

 Calculate and record the temperature change in each case, including whether the temperature increased (+) or decreased (–).

# 3 Two substances, solid E and solution F , were analysed. Solid E was iron(II) sulfate. Tests were 

 done on solid E and solution F. 

 tests on solid E 

 Complete the expected observations. 

 (a) Describe the appearance of solid E. 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [1] 

 Solid E was added to distilled water in a test-tube. The test-tube was shaken to dissolve solid E and form solution E. Solution E was divided into four equal portions in four test-tubes. 

 (b) Dilute nitric acid and aqueous silver nitrate were added to the first portion of solution E.
