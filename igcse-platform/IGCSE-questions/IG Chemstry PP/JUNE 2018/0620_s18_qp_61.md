**2** A student investigated the rate of reaction between dilute hydrochloric acid and aqueous sodium thiosulfate. When these chemicals react they form a precipitate which makes the solution go cloudy. The formation of this precipitate can be used to show how fast the reaction proceeds. 

 Five experiments were done using the apparatus shown.

 Experiment 1 

 ● A large measuring cylinder was used to pour 50 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate into a 250 cm 3 conical flask. The conical flask was placed on a printed sheet of paper. ● 10 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid was added to the solution in the conical flask. A timer was started immediately and the mixture was swirled. ● The time taken for the printed words to disappear from view was measured. 

 Experiment 2 

 ● The large measuring cylinder was used to pour 40 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate into a conical flask, followed by 10 cm^3 of distilled water. The conical flask was placed on the printed sheet of paper. ● 10 cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid was added to the solution in the conical flask. The timer was started immediately and the mixture was swirled. ● The time taken for the printed words to disappear from view was measured. 

 Experiment 3 

 ● Experiment 2 was repeated but using 35 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate and 15 cm 3 of distilled water. 

 Experiment 4 

 ● Experiment 2 was repeated but using 30 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate and 20 cm 3 of distilled water. 

 Experiment 5 

 ● Experiment 2 was repeated but using 10 cm^3 of aqueous sodium thiosulfate and 40 cm 3 of distilled water.
