**Question 1** Each candidate will require the following chemicals and apparatus. **(a)** samples in stoppered test-tubes of: **[MH]** 3 g of hydrated sodium carbonate, Na 2 CO3 .10H 2 O, labelled **3 g of solid C [MH]** 4 g of hydrated sodium carbonate, Na 2 CO3 .10H 2 O, labelled **4 g of solid C [MH]** 6 g of hydrated sodium carbonate, Na 2 CO3 .10H 2 O, labelled **6 g of solid C**. **(b)** samples in stoppered test-tubes of: **[MH]** 3 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate, Na 2 CO3 , labelled **3 g of solid D [MH]** 4 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate, Na 2 CO3 , labelled **4 g of solid D [MH]** 6 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate, Na 2 CO3 , labelled **6 g of solid D [MH]** 8 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate, Na 2 CO3 , labelled **8 g of solid D**. **The anhydrous sodium carbonate should be newly purchased. (c)** access to water and at least 300 cm^3 of distilled water **(d)** 50 cm 3 measuring cylinder **(e)** 250 cm^3 beaker **(f)** stirring thermometer, –10 °C to +110 °C at 1 °C graduations **(g)** polystyrene cup **(h)** stop-clock or timer which can measure to an accuracy of 1 s **(i)** spatula **(j)** teat pipette 

**Note** Confirmatory tests to be performed before the examination. ● 4 g of hydrated sodium carbonate added to 40 cm^3 of distilled water should give a temperature decrease of about 4 °C. ● 4 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate added to 40 cm^3 of distilled water should give a temperature increase of about 5 °C. If you do **not** observe these temperature changes, then you must replace your stocks of hydrated sodium carbonate and anhydrous sodium carbonate accordingly.

**Question 2** Each candidate will require the following chemicals and apparatus. Labels do **not** need to include concentrations. 

# [MH] (a) 0.5 g of hydrated iron(II) sulfate, FeSO 4 .7H 2 O, in a stoppered test-tube labelled solid E 

**[MH] (b)** 0.4 g of calcium chloride in a stoppered test-tube labelled **solid F (c)** aqueous barium nitrate of sufficient concentration to give a positive sulfate test **[MH][N] (d)** aqueous silver nitrate of sufficient concentration to give a positive halide test **[MH][N] (e)** aqueous ammonia of concentration 1 mol / dm 3 **[C] (f)** aqueous nitric acid of concentration 1 mol / dm 3 **[C] (g)** aqueous sodium hydroxide of concentration 1 mol / dm^3 **(h)** distilled water **(i)** pH indicator paper and chart **(j)** 10 cm 3 measuring cylinder **(k)** Bunsen burner and matches **(l)** rack of test-tubes **(m)** hard glass test-tube **(n)** 2 × boiling tube **(o)** stopper to fit boiling tubes **(p)** test-tube holder **(q)** teat pipettes **(r)** spatula
