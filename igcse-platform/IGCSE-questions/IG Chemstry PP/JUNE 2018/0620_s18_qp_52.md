**1** You are going to investigate the temperature changes when two different solids, solid **C** and solid **D** , dissolve in water. 

 Read all the instructions carefully before starting the experiments. 

 Instructions You are going to do two experiments. 

 (a) Experiment 1 

 ● Put the polystyrene cup into the 250 cm^3 beaker for support. ● Use the measuring cylinder to pour 40 cm^3 of distilled water into the polystyrene cup. ● Measure the initial temperature of the distilled water and record it in the first row of the table. ● Add the 3 g sample of solid C to the polystyrene cup and stir the solution with the thermometer. ● Measure and record the temperature of the solution after 1 minute. ● Calculate and record the temperature change, including whether the temperature increased (+) or decreased (–). ● Pour the solution away and rinse out the polystyrene cup with distilled water. 

 ● Repeat the procedure using the 4 g sample of solid C. Record your results and the temperature change, including whether the temperature increased (+) or decreased (–), in the appropriate row of the table. ● Repeat the procedure using the 6 g sample of solid C. Record your results and the temperature change, including whether the temperature increased (+) or decreased (–), in the appropriate row of the table.

 (b) Experiment 2 

 ● Repeat Experiment 1 but using the 3 g, 4 g, 6 g and 8 g samples of solid D. ● Record your results in the table. ● Calculate and record the temperature changes in each case, including whether the temperature increased (+) or decreased (–).

**2** You are provided with two solid salts, solid **E** and solid **F**. Do the following tests on solid **E** and solid **F** , recording all of your observations at each stage. 

 tests on solid E 

 (a) Describe the appearance of solid E. 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [1] 

 (b) Place about half of solid E in a hard glass test-tube. Heat the solid gently then strongly. Record your observations. 

 .................................................................................................................................................... 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [2] 

 Add the rest of solid E to about 10 cm^3 of distilled water in a boiling tube. Stopper the boiling tube and shake it to dissolve solid E and form solution E. Divide solution E into three approximately equal portions in three test-tubes. 

 (c) Add a few drops of dilute nitric acid and about 1 cm^3 of aqueous silver nitrate to the first portion of solution E. Record your observations. 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [1] 

 (d) Add a few drops of dilute nitric acid and about 1 cm^3 of aqueous barium nitrate to the second portion of solution E. Record your observations. 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [1] 

 (e) Add an excess of aqueous sodium hydroxide to the third portion of solution E. Record your observations. 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [2] 

 (f) Identify solid E. 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [2] 


**tests on solid F** 

Add solid **F** to about 10 cm^3 of distilled water in a boiling tube. Stopper the boiling tube and shake it to dissolve solid **F** and form solution **F**. Divide solution **F** into three approximately equal portions in three test-tubes. 

**(g)** Test the pH of the first portion of solution **F**. 

 pH = .............................. [1]
