**2** A teacher investigated the rate of a reaction between two solutions, **J** and **K** , and sulfuric acid at different temperatures. 

 Four experiments were carried out. 

 (a) Experiment 1 

 A large measuring cylinder was used to pour 50 cm^3 of distilled water and 40 cm 3 of sulfuric acid into a 250 cm^3 conical flask. A small measuring cylinder was used to add 2 cm 3 of methyl orange and 5 cm 3 of solution J to the mixture in the conical flask. The temperature of the mixture was measured. The reaction was started by adding 5 cm 3 of solution K to the conical flask, immediately starting the timer and swirling the mixture. The time taken for the mixture to turn pale yellow was measured. The final temperature of the mixture was measured. 

 Experiment 2 

 Experiment 1 was repeated but the mixture in the conical flask was heated to about 30 °C before adding the solution K. The temperature of the mixture was measured. 5 cm 3 of solution K was added to the conical flask. The timer was started and the mixture swirled. The time taken for the mixture to turn pale yellow was measured. The final temperature of the mixture was measured. 

 Experiment 3 

 Experiment 1 was repeated but the mixture in the conical flask was heated to about 40 °C before adding the solution K to the flask. The same measurements were taken. 

 Experiment 4 

 Experiment 1 was repeated but the mixture in the conical flask was heated to about 50 °C before adding the solution K to the flask. The same measurements were taken. 

 Stop-clock diagrams for these experiments are on page 4.

**4** The label on a bottle of orange drink stated ‘contains no artificial colours’. A scientist thought that the orange colour in the drink was a mixture of two artificial colours: 

- Sunset Yellow E110 

- Allura Red E129 

 Plan an investigation to show that the orange colour in the drink did not contain these two artificial colours. You are provided with samples of E110, E129 and the orange colouring from the drink. You are also provided with common laboratory apparatus. You may draw a diagram to help answer the question.
