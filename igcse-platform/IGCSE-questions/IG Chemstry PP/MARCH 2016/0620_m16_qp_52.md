**1** You are going to investigate the rate of a reaction between two solutions, **J** and **K** , and sulfuric acid at different temperatures. 

 Read all the instructions below carefully before starting the experiments. 

 Instructions You are going to carry out four experiments. 

 (a) Experiment 1 

 Use the large measuring cylinder to pour 50 cm 3 of distilled water and 40 cm 3 of sulfuric acid into the 250 cm^3 conical flask. Use the small measuring cylinder to add 2 cm 3 of methyl orange and 5 cm 3 of solution J to the mixture in the conical flask. Measure the temperature of the mixture and record it in the table. Use the small measuring cylinder to now start the reaction by adding 5 cm 3 of solution K to the conical flask and immediately start your timer and swirl the mixture. Measure the time taken for the mixture to turn very pale yellow and record the time in the table. Measure and record the final temperature of the mixture. 

 Experiment 2 

 Repeat Experiment 1 but heat the mixture in the conical flask to about 30 °C before adding the solution K. Measure and record the temperature of the mixture. Now add 5 cm 3 of solution K to the conical flask and immediately start your timer and swirl the mixture. Measure the time taken for the mixture to turn very pale yellow and record the time in the table. Measure and record the final temperature of the mixture. 

 Experiment 3 

 Repeat Experiment 1 but heat the mixture in the conical flask to about 40 °C before adding the solution K to the conical flask. Take the same measurements and record the values in the table. 

 Experiment 4 

 Repeat Experiment 1 but heat the mixture in the conical flask to about 50 °C before adding the solution K to the conical flask. Take the same measurements and record the values in the table. 

 Work out the average temperatures to complete the table.

**2** You are provided with two solids, **L** and **M** , which are both salts. Carry out the following tests on the solids, recording all of your observations at each stage. 

 tests on solid L 

 (a) Describe the appearance of solid L. 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [1] 

 (b) Add about 10 cm^3 of distilled water to solid L and shake the mixture for about one minute to dissolve. 

 Divide the solution into four equal portions in four test-tubes and carry out the following tests. 

 (i) Add several drops of aqueous ammonia to the first portion of the solution. 

 Now add excess ammonia solution to the mixture and shake.

 (ii) Add excess aqueous sodium hydroxide to the second portion of the solution. 

 observation ......................................................................................................................... 

 ....................................................................................................................................... [1] 

 (iii) Add about 1 cm^3 of dilute nitric acid to the third portion of the solution followed by aqueous silver nitrate. 

 observation ................................................................................................................... [1] 

 (iv) Add about 1 cm 3 of dilute nitric acid to the fourth portion of the solution followed by aqueous barium nitrate. 

 observation ................................................................................................................... [1] 

 (c) Identify solid L. 

 .................................................................................................................................................... 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [2] 


**tests on solid M** 

**(d)** Use a spatula to divide solid **M** into two portions in two test-tubes. 

 Heat the first portion of the solid, gently. Test the gas given off with damp red litmus paper. 

 observation ................................................................................................................................ 

 .................................................................................................................................................... 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [3] 

**(e)** Dissolve the second portion of the solid in about 6 cm 3 of water. Pour half of the solution into a boiling tube. 

 (i) Add about 1 cm^3 of aqueous sodium hydroxide to the solution in the boiling tube and heat the mixture gently. Test the gas given off. 

 observation ................................................................................................................... [1] 

 (ii) Add about 1 cm 3 of dilute nitric acid to the remaining solution in the test-tube followed by aqueous silver nitrate.

**3** The label on a bottle of orange drink stated ‘contains no artificial colours’. A scientist thought that the orange colour in the drink was a mixture of two artificial colours: 

- Sunset Yellow E110 

- Allura Red E129 

 Plan an investigation to show that the orange colour in the drink did not contain these two artificial colours. You are provided with samples of E110, E129 and the orange colouring from the drink. You are also provided with common laboratory apparatus. You may draw a diagram to help answer the question.
