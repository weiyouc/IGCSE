**1** The leaves of plants contain chlorophyll and other coloured pigments that are used in photosynthesis to trap light. Some students investigated the pigments present in a green leaf using chromatography. The process of chromatography separates the pigments. The more soluble the pigment the further it moves. In this experiment the pigments in a green leaf were dissolved in a solvent ( **S1** ). The solvent moved up the paper carrying the dissolved pigments different distances. Step 1 The pigments from a green leaf were transferred to a strip of chromatography paper by pressing the leaf onto the paper using the edge of a metal disc. A green line was then visible on the paper as shown in Fig. 1.1.

 Fig. 1.1 Step 2 Solvent S1 was poured into a test-tube to a depth of 2 cm. Step 3 The strip of chromatography paper was lowered into the test-tube with the green line at the bottom so that part of the chromatography paper was in solvent S1. The green line remained above the level of solvent S1 as shown in Fig. 1.2.

The movement of solvent S1 up the chromatography paper was observed for 15 minutes. Step 5 After 15 minutes the strip of chromatography paper was removed from the test-tube.

 Step 6 The chromatography paper was placed on a paper towel and a pencil line was drawn across the paper to mark how far up the chromatography paper solvent S1 had moved. (a) Fig. 1.3 shows a diagram of the chromatography paper after it was dry.

 (iii) The students investigated the pigments in another type of green leaf using the same method. State two variables that should be kept constant in this investigation. 1 ........................................................................................................................................ 2 ........................................................................................................................................ [2] (b) Some students used a different method to obtain the pigments from a leaf by cutting up the leaf and grinding it with ethanol. They filtered the mixture and obtained a chlorophyll extract which was then evaporated until only a small volume of extract remained. Ethanol is flammable. (i) State one safety precaution that the students would take when evaporating substances containing ethanol. ........................................................................................................................................... ..................................................................................................................................... [1] (ii) A start line was drawn in pencil on a piece of chromatography paper. A small drop of the concentrated chlorophyll extract was placed on the start line and allowed to dry. The chromatography paper was then placed in a test-tube containing a different solvent ( S2 ) and left for 10 minutes. Fig. 1.4 shows the appearance of the chromatography paper after it was removed from solvent S2 and allowed to dry.

 The different pigments can be compared by calculating their Rf value. Rf value = the maximum distance moved by the pigment from the start linethe maximum distance moved by the solvent from the start line Fig. 1.4 shows where these distances were measured on the chromatography paper for the green pigment. The students calculated some of the Rf values. The results are shown in Fig. 1.5.

 (f) Some plants have leaves that are not green. For example the plant may have red, purple or yellow leaves. A student predicted that leaves of different colours would have different rates of photosynthesis.

 Fig. 2.1 (i) Scientists count the number of red blood cells to estimate the total number of red blood cells in the blood. Cells that are touching the top and left side of the grid are counted. Cells touching the bottom and right side of the grid are not counted. State how many cells would not be counted in the sample in Fig. 2.1. .......................... [1]

Calculate the number of red blood cells per mm 3 of undiluted blood. Use the formula: number of red blood cells per mm 3 = red blood cells counted × dilutionvolume of the counting grid Space for working.

 (c) Anaemia can also be diagnosed by measuring the haemoglobin content of the blood. Samples of blood were collected from 1800 men and 2400 women. The haemoglobin content of their blood was measured and the percentage of people with anaemia was calculated. Table 2.2 shows the percentage of men and women in the sample who have anaemia.
