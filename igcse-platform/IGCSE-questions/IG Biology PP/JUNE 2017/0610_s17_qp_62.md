**1** A student wanted to investigate the effect of different growing conditions on the rate of photosynthesis in plants. When photosynthesis takes place in a leaf oxygen gas is produced and this is released into the air spaces in the leaf. carbon dioxide + water glucose + oxygen When small discs are cut from the leaf, the gases in the air spaces in the leaf discs can be removed. This allows the leaf discs to sink when they are placed in a liquid. As photosynthesis takes place the leaf discs start to float. The time taken for the leaf discs to float indicates the rate of photosynthesis. Step 1 A student selected two plants, **X** and **Y** , which were of the same species but were growing in two different locations. Step 2 One leaf was removed from plant **X** and five small discs were cut from the leaf. Each leaf disc was 8 mm in diameter. Step 3 The student placed the five leaf discs from plant **X** into a syringe containing 5 cm^3 of 2% sodium hydrogencarbonate solution.

The leaf discs then sank to the bottom of the syringe as shown in Fig. 1.1b.

 Step 5 The five leaf discs from plant X were removed from the syringe and each one was placed into a separate test-tube in a test-tube rack. 2% sodium hydrogencarbonate solution was poured into each test-tube to a height of approximately 5 cm from the bottom of the test-tube. This is shown in Fig. 1.2.

**2 (a)** Fig. 2.1 and Fig. 2.2 are photomicrographs of cross-sections of leaves taken from different areas of the same tree. Some parts of the tree are shaded from the Sun and some parts are in direct sunlight. The cross-section shown in Fig. 2.1 was taken from a leaf grown in the shade and the cross-section shown in Fig. 2.2 was taken from a leaf grown in direct sunlight.
