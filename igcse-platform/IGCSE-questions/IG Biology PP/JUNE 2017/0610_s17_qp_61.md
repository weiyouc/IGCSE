**1** Proteins are an important part of the diet. These proteins are used in the body to make enzymes and other cell structures. You are going to estimate the concentration of protein in two solutions, **A** and **B** , using the results from a set of standard protein solutions. Known concentrations of protein solution were made. Using biuret reagent, the colour intensity score was determined at each concentration. Step 1 Seven test-tubes were labelled **1** , **2** , **3** , **4** , **5** , **6** and **7**. Step 2 Solutions containing different concentrations of protein were made using the volumes of 1% protein solution and distilled water shown in Table 1.1. **Table 1.1** test-tube number **1 2 3 4 5 6 7** volume of 1% protein solution / cm^3 0.00^ 0.25^ 0.50^ 1.00^ 2.00^ 3.00^ 4.00 volume of distilled water / cm^3 5.00^ 4.75^ 4.50^ 4.00^ 3.00^ 2.00^ 1.00 percentage concentration of protein solution 0.00 0.05 0.20 0.40 0.60 **(a) (i)** Complete Table 1.1 by calculating the percentage concentration of the protein solutions in test-tubes **3** and **7**. Write your answers in Table 1.1. Show your working.

 (ii) State the colour that shows the presence of protein when tested with biuret reagent. .......................................................................................................................................[1] Step 3 2 cm^3 of biuret reagent was added to each of the solutions in the test-tubes, 1 to 7. Each test-tube was shaken gently to mix the contents. Step 4 The test-tubes were placed in a test-tube rack in order of concentration, from the least concentrated to most concentrated. Step 5 2 cm^3 of biuret reagent was added to the protein solution in the test-tube labelled A and shaken gently to mix the contents. Step 6 Step 5 was repeated for the protein solution in test-tube B.

 Step 7 Test-tubes 1 to 7 were held against a white background so that the colour of the solutions were clearly visible. These test-tubes are shown in Fig. 1.1. Step 8 The colour intensity of the solution in test-tube 7 was given a score using Table 1.2.

Test-tubes that have the same colour intensity should be given the same score. [1] (iv) Prepare a table to record the results for test-tubes 1 to 7. Your table should show: 

- the concentration of the protein solutions 

- the colour intensity score given to each of the solutions.

**2** Yeast cells have a **cell wall** on the outside that appears as a dark layer and a large paler coloured **vacuole** occupying most of the cell. The **nucleus** is round and often found near the centre of the cell. It is much smaller and darker than the vacuole. Yeast grows by forming small **buds** on one side of the cell that eventually break off. Fig. 2.1 shows a photograph of yeast cells viewed through a microscope. **(a) (i)** On Fig. 2.1 label **two** of these features of yeast cells.

 (b) Some students measured respiration in yeast using a culture of active yeast. Yeast produces a gas during respiration. Two syringes were filled with 20 cm^3 of the active yeast culture and each syringe was placed into a large test-tube containing water at 35 °C. Both were placed in a water-bath at 35 °C as shown in Fig. 2.2. The volume of gas in each syringe was measured every 5 minutes for 25 minutes.
