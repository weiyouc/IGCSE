MARK SCHEME 

Maximum Mark: 40 

 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. 

Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2017 series for most Cambridge IGCSE®, Cambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and some Cambridge O Level components.

**Question Answer Marks Guidance** 

 1(d) source of error ;; improvement ;; contamination washing all apparatus / use new syringes overshoot of end-point / adding too much iodine / many drops 

 add smaller quantities of iodine 

 determination of end-point allow sufficient time for colour to change / use colorimeter / colour standard change in vitamin C with time test same time after extraction for each no repeats repeat each concentration AVP e.g. difficult reading scale coloured vegetable extracts 

 AVP e.g. use burette 

 4 improvement must relate to given error 

 A subjective colour change
