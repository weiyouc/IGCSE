MARK SCHEME 

Maximum Mark: 40 

 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. 

Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2017 series for most Cambridge IGCSE®, Cambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and some Cambridge O Level components.

 2(b)(ii) error: loss of yeast from syringe (so less respiration / gas released) ; improvement: idea of: sealed syringe / 3-way tap and collecting gas using gas syringe / AW ; 

 error: idea of taking up, air / froth, with the yeast ; improvement: filling from below the level of the foam ; 

 error: samples of yeast may vary in concentration ; improvement: mix / stir, the culture before removing samples ; 

 error: no method of maintaining temperature ; improvement: use a thermostatically controlled water bath / Bunsen burner and thermometer / idea of insulation ; 

 error: syringe containing yeast not equilibrated before using ; improvement: idea of leaving for a time to reach, correct temperature / 35 °C ; 

 error: syringe has an imprecise scale ; improvement: use a syringe with more graduations ; 

 2 improvement must relate to the error given
