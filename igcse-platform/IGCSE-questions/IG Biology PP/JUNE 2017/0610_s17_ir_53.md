## READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST 

These Confidential Instructions give details of the apparatus required by each candidate for each experiment in this paper. A summary of the questions that will be presented to the candidates is included, where appropriate, to allow the biology teacher to test the apparatus appropriately. **Testing must be done out of sight of all candidates. No access to the question paper is permitted in advance of the examination.** Centres are reminded that candidates are expected to follow the instructions on the question paper and record all their results. They will not be penalised if these results are not what they expect. The Supervisor should make sure the Supervisor’s Report is fully completed and a copy is enclosed with each packet of scripts. It is assumed that the ordinary apparatus of a science laboratory will be available, including a supply of purified water (distilled or deionised). If arrangements are made for different sessions for different groups of candidates, care must be taken to ensure that the different groups of candidates are effectively isolated so that **no information passes between them**. **All specimens should carry only the code letters and numbers as indicated and their identity should not be revealed to the candidates.** Supervisors should ensure that all specimens have the correct identity attached to the specimen and that these are **not** removed during the examination. If a candidate breaks any of the apparatus, or loses any of the material supplied, the matter should be rectified and a note made in the Supervisor’s Report. Supervisors are advised to remind candidates that **all** substances in the examination should be treated with caution. Pipette fillers and eye protection should be used where necessary. In accordance with COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) Regulations, operative in the UK, a hazard appraisal of the examination has been carried out. The following codes are used where relevant: **C** corrosive **MH** moderate hazard **HH** health hazard **T** acutely toxic **F** flammable **O** oxidising **N** hazardous to the aquatic environment Centres are reminded that they are **not** permitted to open the question paper envelopes before the examination. If there are any difficulties with any aspect of setting up this practical examination that the Centre is not able to resolve, it is essential for Centres to contact Cambridge as soon as possible by **email** to info@ cie.org.uk, by **fax** to +44 1223 553558 or by **phone** to +44 1223 553554.

**Question 1** Each candidate should be provided with: **(i)** one beaker containing 25 cm^3 of solution P, labelled **P (ii)** one beaker containing 25 cm^3 of solution Q, labelled **Q (iii)** one beaker containing 25 cm^3 of solution R, labelled **R (iv)** 40 cm^3 of freshly prepared iodine solution, in a beaker labelled **iodine solution (v)** 10 cm^3 of 1% starch solution in a beaker labelled **starch solution (vi)** two 10 cm^3 syringes (without needles) **(vii)** one 1 cm^3 syringe (without needle) **(viii)** three large test-tubes **(ix)** one large test-tube rack **(x)** container labelled **waste (xi)** beaker or wash bottle containing tap water for washing, labelled **water for washing (xii)** white tile or white card **(xiii)** eye protection **(xiv)** plastic gloves 

**Preparation of solutions** 1 dm^3 of solutions P, Q and R will be sufficient for a maximum of 10 candidates. _Solution P_ Dissolve 2.0 g of ascorbic acid in 700 cm^3 of distilled water. Add distilled water to make up to 1 dm^3. _Solution Q_ Dissolve 1.0 g of ascorbic acid in 700 cm^3 of distilled water. Add distilled water to make up to 1 dm^3. _Solution R_ Dissolve 0.5 g of ascorbic acid in 700 cm^3 of distilled water. Add distilled water to make up to 1 dm^3. _1% starch solution_ Heat 1.0 g of soluble starch in 90 cm^3 of distilled water until the liquid clears. Allow the solution to cool and add distilled water to make up to 100 cm^3.

_iodine solution_ A commercially prepared iodine solution such as Lugol’s iodine solution may be used. Alternatively it can be made as follows: Wear eye protection, disposable gloves and work in a well-ventilated room. Put 20 g of potassium iodide (KI) into a beaker and moisten the potassium iodide with a few drops of distilled water. Add 10 g of iodine (I 2 ) to the moistened potassium iodide. Add a small volume of distilled water and stir. When no more iodine appears to dissolve add more distilled water and stir. Keep repeating this procedure until all the iodine has dissolved. Do not exceed the total final volume of 1 dm^3. If necessary add more distilled water to make up to the total final volume of 1 dm^3. 

 The Supervisor ( not the Invigilator) is expected to carry out the practical aspects of Question 1 and record their results in the space provided in the Supervisor’s Report. This must be done during the examination, using the same apparatus and reagents as the candidates but out of sight of candidates.
