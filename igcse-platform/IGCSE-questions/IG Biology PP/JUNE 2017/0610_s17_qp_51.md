**1** Proteins are an important part of the diet. These proteins are used in the body to make enzymes and other cell structures. You are going to estimate the concentration of protein in two solutions, **A** and **B** , using a set of standard protein solutions. **Read all the instructions but DO NOT CARRY THEM OUT until you have drawn a table for your results in the space provided in (a)(ii).** You should use the gloves and eye protection provided while you are carrying out the practical work. Step 1 Label seven empty test-tubes **1** , **2** , **3** , **4** , **5** , **6** and **7**. Step 2 Make the seven solutions containing the different concentrations of protein shown in Table 1.1. To make solution **1** use a clean syringe, of appropriate size, to measure the volumes of 1% protein solution and distilled water stated in Table 1.1. Add these volumes to the testtube labelled **1**. Continue this procedure until you have made all seven solutions in the seven labelled test-tubes. **Table 1.1** test-tube number **1 2 3 4 5 6 7** volume of 1% protein solution / cm^3 4.00 3.00 2.00 1.00 0.50 0.25 0.00 volume of distilled water / cm^3 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 4.50 4.75 5.00 percentage concentration of protein solution 0.60 0.40 0.20 0.05 0.00 **(a) (i)** Complete Table 1.1 by calculating the percentage concentration of the protein solutions in test-tubes **1** and **5**. Write your answers in Table 1.1. Show your working.

 Step 3 Add 2 cm^3 of biuret reagent to each of the solutions in the test-tubes, 1 to 7. Shake each test-tube gently to mix the contents. Step 4 Place the test-tubes in a test-tube rack in order of concentration, from the least concentrated to the most concentrated. Leave for 5 minutes. Step 5 You have been provided with two test-tubes labelled A and B. They contain protein solutions of unknown concentrations. Add 2 cm^3 of biuret reagent to the protein solution in the test-tube labelled A. Shake the test-tube gently to mix the contents.

 Step 6 Add 2 cm^3 of biuret reagent to the protein solution in the test-tube labelled B. Shake the test-tube gently to mix the contents. Step 7 Leave test-tubes A and B in a test-tube rack for 5 minutes. Continue with the other steps. Step 8 Hold each of the test-tubes 1 to 7 against a white background and record the colour in your table. Step 9 Give each of the test-tubes 1 to 7 a colour intensity score using the symbols in Table 1.2. Test-tubes that have the same colour intensity should have the same score. Table 1.2 colour intensity palest darkest score + ++ +++ ++++ (ii) Prepare a table to record your results for test-tubes 1 to 7. Your table should show: 

# • the concentration of the protein solutions 

# • the colour of each of the solutions 

# • the colour intensity score given to each of the solutions. 

 Record your results in your table as you carry out the practical work.

 Step 10 Compare the colour intensity of the solution in test-tube A with the colour intensity of the solutions in test-tubes 1 to 7. Give test-tube A a colour intensity score and record it in (a)(iii). Step 11 Repeat step 10 for test-tube B.

**2** Yeast cells have a **cell wall** on the outside that appears as a dark layer and a large paler coloured **vacuole** occupying most of the cell. The **nucleus** is round and often found near the centre of the cell. It is much smaller and darker than the vacuole. Yeast grows by forming small **buds** on one side of the cell that eventually break off. Fig. 2.1 shows a photograph of yeast cells viewed through a microscope. **(a) (i)** On Fig. 2.1 label **two** of these features of yeast cells.

 (b) Some students measured respiration in yeast using a culture of active yeast. Yeast produces a gas during respiration. Two syringes were filled with 20 cm^3 of the active yeast culture and each syringe was placed into a large test-tube containing water at 35 °C. Both were placed in a water-bath at 35 °C as shown in Fig. 2.2. The volume of gas in each syringe was measured every 5 minutes for 25 minutes.
