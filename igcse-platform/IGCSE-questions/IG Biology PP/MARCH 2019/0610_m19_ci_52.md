# General information about practical exams 

Centres must follow the guidance on science practical exams given in the _Cambridge Handbook_. 

## Safety 

Supervisors must follow national and local regulations relating to safety and first aid. 

Only those procedures described in the question paper should be attempted. 

Supervisors must inform candidates that materials and apparatus used in the exam should be treated with caution. Suitable eye protection should be used where necessary. 

The following hazard codes are used in these confidential instructions, where relevant: 

 C corrosive MH moderate hazard HH health hazard T acutely toxic F flammable O oxidising N hazardous to the aquatic environment 

Hazard data sheets relating to substances used in this exam should be available from your chemical supplier. 

## Before the exam 

 ● The packets containing the question papers must not be opened before the exam. ● It is assumed that standard school laboratory facilities, as indicated in the Guide to Planning Practical Science , will be available. ● Spare materials and apparatus for the tasks set must be available for candidates, if required. 

## During the exam 

 ● It must be made clear to candidates at the start of the exam that they may request spare materials and apparatus for the tasks set. ● Where specified, the supervisor must perform the experiments and record the results as instructed. This must be done out of sight of the candidates, using the same materials and apparatus as the candidates. ● Any assistance provided to candidates must be recorded in the supervisor’s report. ● If any materials or apparatus need to be replaced, for example, in the event of breakage or loss, this must be recorded in the supervisor’s report. 

## After the exam 

 ● The supervisor must complete a report for each practical session held and each laboratory used. ● Each packet of scripts returned to Cambridge International must contain the following items: 

 ● the scripts of the candidates specified on the bar code label provided ● the supervisor’s results relevant to these candidates ● the supervisor’s reports relevant to these candidates ● seating plans for each practical session, referring to each candidate by candidate number ● the attendance register.

# Specific information for this practical exam 

 During the exam, the supervisor (NOT the invigilator) must do the experiment in Question 1 and record their results on a spare copy of the question paper, clearly labelled ‘supervisor’s results’. 

**Question 1** 

Each candidate should be provided with: 

 hazard materials and apparatus quantity per candidate 

 pieces of dry cloth stained with food dye 4 

 glass rod 1 

 white tile approximately 10 cm × 10 cm 1 

 marker pen to write on the white tile 1 

 stop-clock 1 

 refer to packaging 

 100 cm^3 of bio washing solution in a 250 cm^3 beaker labelled bio 

### 1 

 refer to packaging 

 100 cm^3 of non-bio washing solution in a 250 cm^3 beaker labelled non-bio 

### 1 

 100 cm^3 of distilled water in a 250 cm^3 beaker labelled water 

### 1 

 forceps 1 pair 

 gloves 1 pair 

 eye protection 1 

 paper towels 6 

**Preparation of materials** 

_Stained cloth_ 

Cut white cotton fabric into pieces that measure approximately 5 cm × 5 cm. Place the pieces of white cotton cloth into a solution of food dye. An intense colour such as red or blue is suitable. The food dye can be diluted by 50% but must be concentrated enough to stain the fabric. 

Stir the cloth into the food dye solution so it is completely immersed and then leave for at least one hour. 

Dry the pieces of cloth in a drier, or leave to air-dry for at least 24 hours. The cloth pieces must be completely dry when presented to candidates. 

_Bio washing solution_ 

Dissolve approximately 20 g of biological washing powder or liquid in 1 dm^3 of warm tap water.

_Non-bio washing solution_ 

Dissolve approximately 20 g of non-biological washing powder or liquid in 1 dm^3 of warm tap water. If non-biological washing powder is not available dish-washing liquid or liquid hand soap are suitable alternatives. 

Once prepared, the solutions for candidates do not need to be kept warm. Solutions can be provided to candidates at room temperature. 

**Question 2** 

Each candidate should be provided with: 

 hazard materials and apparatus quantity per candidate 

 30 cm transparent plastic ruler 1
