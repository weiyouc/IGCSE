 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. 

Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2016 series for most Cambridge IGCSE®^ , Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components.

**Abbreviations used in the Mark Scheme:** 

- **;** separates marking points

- **I** ignore 

- **R** reject 

- **A** accept (for answers correctly cued by the question, or guidance for examiners) 

- AW alternative wording 

- AVP any valid point 

- ecf credit a correct statement / calculation that follows a previous wrong response 

- **ora** or reverse argument 

- ( ) the word / phrase in brackets is not required, but sets the context 

- underline actual words given must be used by the candidate (or grammatical variants of them)
