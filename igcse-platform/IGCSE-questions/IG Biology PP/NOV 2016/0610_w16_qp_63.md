**1** Catalase is an enzyme found in plant and animal cells. It catalyses the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to form water and oxygen. hydrogen peroxide catalase water + oxygen 2H 2 O 2 2H 2 O + O 2 Students investigated the effect of surface area on the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide by catalase. They used potato as a source of catalase. They varied the surface area of the potato and measured the volume of oxygen gas produced by the break down of the hydrogen peroxide. Step 1 Three potato sticks, of the same diameter, were placed next to each other on a white tile. Each potato stick was cut to exactly 4 cm in length. Step 2 One of the potato sticks was cut into eight equal pieces as shown in Fig. 1.1. 

 Fig. 1.1 Step 3 Step 2 was repeated with another potato stick. The last potato stick was left whole. Step 4 A 25 cm 3 measuring cylinder was submerged in a tub of water and allowed to fill with water. The measuring cylinder was turned upside down keeping the open end under the water in the tub as shown in Fig. 1.2. large test-tube bung^ delivery tube inverted measuring cylinder

 A practice experiment was carried out using one of the potato sticks that had been cut into eight pieces. Step 5 The open end of the delivery tube was placed into the inverted measuring cylinder in the tub of water. Step 6 A syringe was used to add 20 cm 3 of hydrogen peroxide to a large test-tube. Step 7 All eight pieces of potato were added to the large test-tube and the delivery tube bung was immediately placed into the large test-tube. Step 8 A timer was started and the large test-tube was shaken every 30 seconds for three minutes. Step 9 The volume of oxygen gas collected in the measuring cylinder for the practice experiment was recorded as 2.5 cm^3. Step 10 The contents of the large test-tube were discarded. The large test-tube was rinsed with distilled water before being reused. Step 11 Steps 4 to 8 were repeated with the remaining whole potato stick. The volume of oxygen gas collected is shown in Fig. 1.3. Step 12 Steps 4 to 8 were repeated using the remaining potato stick that had been cut into eight pieces. The volume of oxygen gas collected is shown in Fig. 1.3.
