The students measured and observed maize grown in the light and maize grown in the dark. Fig. 1.2 shows the surface of two pots containing maize seedlings, one set grown in the light and the other set grown in the dark. The seedlings were grown at 20 °C and watered every day for ten days. Step 1 Observe the appearance of the seedlings carefully. **(a)** Complete Table 1.1 to record two **visible** differences in the seedlings grown in the light and the seedlings grown in the dark shown in Fig. 1.2. **Table 1.1** feature seedlings grown in the light seedlings grown in the dark

 You are going to measure the length of the coleoptiles and the total length of the seedlings visible above the soil. You will measure all the seedlings grown in the light and all the seedlings grown in the dark. 

 (b) (i) Prepare a table to record your results in the space below.

 Step 2 Use a ruler to measure the length of the coleoptile and the total length of the seedling visible above the soil for each seedling. 

 Record your results in your table. 

 (ii) State two conclusions that can be made about the effect of light on the germination and early growth of maize.

 Step 3 A line was marked down the centre of a white tile and labelled L on one side and D on the other side. 

 Step 4 The three seedlings grown in the light and the three seedlings grown in the dark were dug out from each pot after ten days. 

 Step 5 The remains of the food store was cut away from each of the seedlings and washed in water. The outer skin was removed. 

 Step 6 The food stores were then placed on the white tile. The food stores from the seedlings grown in the light were placed on the side of the tile labelled L and the food stores from the seedlings grown in the dark were placed on the side labelled D. 

 Step 7 A clean spatula was used to crush together the three food stores from the seedlings grown in the light. This was then separated into three equal parts on the L side of the tile, as shown in Fig. 1.3. 

 Step 8 The spatula was cleaned and used to crush together the three food stores from the seedlings grown in the dark. This was also separated into three equal parts on the D side of the tile, as shown in Fig. 1.3.

 Step 9 One of the food stores from the seedlings grown in the light was placed into a test-tube labelled L and 2 cm 3 of water added, taking care to wash the crushed food store to the bottom of the test-tube.

 Step 10 Step 9 was repeated using one of the food stores from the seedlings grown in the dark and a test-tube labelled D. 

 Step 11 A Benedict’s test was carried out on the contents of test-tube L and test-tube D. 

 Step 12 A drop of iodine solution was added to one of the remaining food stores from the seedlings grown in the light and to one of the remaining food store from the seedlings grown in the dark on the white tile. 

 Step 13 A drop of biuret reagent was added to each of the remaining food stores.

 (d) A group of students investigated the changes in dry mass during germination and growth of maize grown in the light and maize grown in the dark. 

 The dry mass is the total mass left after all the water has been evaporated. 

 Table 1.3 shows the results of the investigation for the maize seedlings grown in the light.

**2 (a)** A group of students investigated the effect of two different exercises on the heart rate of ten male and ten female students. 

 Before the first exercise, the pulse rate at rest was measured and the group then jumped on the same spot for two minutes without moving their arms. Every two seconds an investigator shouted jump. 

 After two minutes the pulse rate was measured and the students were allowed ten minutes to rest. 

 Before the second exercise, the pulse rate at rest was measured again and the group was asked to do a different exercise. 

 The students jumped on the same spot for two minutes lifting their arms above their head as they jumped up and dropping their arms as they came down. Every two seconds an investigator shouted ‘jump’. 

 Table 2.1 shows the results of this investigation.
