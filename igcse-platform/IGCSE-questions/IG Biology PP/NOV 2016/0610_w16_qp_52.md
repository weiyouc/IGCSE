**Read through all the questions on this paper carefully before starting work.** 

**1** Maize (corn) is an important food crop that produces grain. Fig. 1.1 shows a maize grain that has germinated to form a seedling.

You will measure and observe maize grown in the light and maize grown in the dark. Three maize grains were planted in each of the two pots labelled **L** and **D**. One pot ( **L** ) was placed in the light and the other pot ( **D** ) placed in the dark. The seedlings were kept at a constant temperature. Step 1 Observe the appearance of the seedlings carefully. **(a)** Complete Table 1.1 by recording two **visible** differences in the seedlings grown in the light and the seedlings grown in the dark. **Table 1.1** feature seedlings grown in the light seedlings grown in the dark

 You are going to measure the length of the coleoptiles and the total length of the seedlings visible above the soil. You will measure all the seedlings grown in the light and all the seedlings grown in the dark. 

 (b) (i) Prepare a table to record your results. 

## [6] 

 Step 2 Use a ruler to measure the length of the coleoptile and the total length of the seedling visible above the soil for each seedling. 

 Record the results for the seedlings grown in pot L and in pot D in your table. 

 (ii) Look at Table 1.1 and the results of your measurements. State two conclusions that can be made about the effect of light on the germination and early growth of maize.

 Use gloves and eye protection while carrying out steps 3 to 14 of the practical work for question 1. 

 Step 3 Use a marker pen to draw a line down the centre of a white tile. Label one side L and the other side D. 

 Step 4 Use a spatula to carefully dig out from each pot, two of the seedlings grown in the light and two of the seedlings grown in the dark. 

 Step 5 Use a scalpel or razor blade to cut the remains of the food store from each of the seedlings. 

 Step 6 Use the water in the beaker labelled water for washing to wash each of these food stores and remove the outer covering. Put the outer covering in the beaker labelled waste. 

 Step 7 Place the food stores from the seedlings grown in the light on the side of the tile labelled L and the food stores from seedlings grown in the dark on the side of the tile labelled D. 

 Step 8 Wash the spatula in the beaker labelled water for washing and dry it with a paper towel. Use the spatula to crush together the two food stores from the seedlings grown in the light on the part of the tile labelled L. 

 Separate the crushed food store into two equal parts spaced at least 2 cm apart, as shown in Fig. 1.2. 

 Step 9 Repeat step 8 using the two food stores from the seedlings grown in the dark on the part of the tile labelled D.

 Fig. 1.2 

 Step 10 Label two test-tubes, one with the letter L and the other with the letter D. 

 Step 11 Scrape one of the food stores from the seedlings grown in the light into the test-tube labelled L. Add 2 cm^3 of water from the beaker labelled water , taking care to wash the crushed food store to the bottom of the test-tube. 

 Step 12 Repeat step 11 using one of the food stores from the seedlings grown in the dark and the test-tube labelled D. 

 Step 13 Carry out a Benedict’s test on the contents of test-tube L and test-tube D. 

 Raise your hand when you are ready for hot water to be placed in the beaker labelled water-bath. 

 Leave the test-tubes for 5 minutes. 

 During this time carry out step 14 and answer question (c)(i). 

 Step 14 Add 1 drop of iodine solution to the remaining two food stores on the white tile. Record your results in Table 1.2.

 (d) A group of students investigated the changes in dry mass during germination and growth of maize grown in the light and maize grown in the dark. 

 The dry mass is the total mass left after all the water has been evaporated. 

 Table 1.3 shows the results of the investigation for the maize seedlings grown in the light.

**2 (a)** A group of students investigated the effect of two different exercises on the heart rate of ten male and ten female students. 

 Before the first exercise, the pulse rate at rest was measured and the group then jumped on the same spot for two minutes without moving their arms. Every two seconds an investigator shouted ‘jump’. 

 After two minutes the pulse rate was measured and the students were allowed ten minutes to rest. 

 Before the second exercise, the pulse rate at rest was measured again and the group was asked to do a different exercise. 

 The students jumped on the same spot for two minutes lifting their arms above their head as they jumped up and dropping their arms as they came down. Every two seconds an investigator shouted ‘jump’. 

 Table 2.1 shows the results of this investigation.
