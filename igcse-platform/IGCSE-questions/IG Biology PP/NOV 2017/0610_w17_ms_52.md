MARK SCHEME 

Maximum Mark: 40 

 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. 

Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2017 series for most Cambridge IGCSE®, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components.

 1(a)(i) table drawn with minimum two columns and a line between heading and data ; 

 appropriate column / row headings and appropriate units for percentage concentration of amylase time for starch to be digested / minutes ; 

 three correct amylase concentration recorded in any order ; 

 table shows 2 columns for each concentration with times recorded ; 

 correct trend shown by results ; 

 5 R if units in body of table 

 I units in the body of the table 

 (expect 3% faster 2% faster 1%) 

 1(a)(ii) idea that iodine remains brown / yellow / orange / no longer changes colour ;

 1(a)(iii) (remove a sample from each of the test-tubes and) add (equal volume of) Benedict’s solution ;

 1(b)(i) variable controlled by (volume of) starch (solution) 5 cm^3 / same volume (concentration of) starch solution 

 same concentration / used throughout volume of enzyme / amylase 1 cm^3 used 

 temperature kept at 55–60 ° C time 3 minutes for incubation / 5 minutes for testing the enzyme ; ; 

 2 one mark for the variable, one mark for method of controlling which must related 

 I amount of enzyme 

 I same temperature 

 1(b)(ii) so the contents of all the test-tubes reach the same temperature / AW ;

 1(c)(i) idea of judging the colour of the endpoint by eye ; 

 idea of doing several procedures at the same time ; 

 idea that only one drop for both spots of iodine (might give different volumes ) ; 

 idea that 1 drop for both spots (could cause contamination) ; 

 idea of: two samples needed at the same time with the same rod, (then there will be a difference in the actual time) ; 

 idea of: size of drops (from either starch or iodine) added varies ;

 1(c)(ii) e.g. of error improvement judging colour by eye have a standard colour for comparison timing and sampling at same time 

 start timer then mix and sample and note time when first sample taken one drop for two samples use a dropper with enough for both samples / have two glass rods contamination use separate glass rods doing two samples at the same time 

 take a sample from each tube at the same time with different glass rod / do trials separately size of drop for either use a syringe / pipette 

 time not long enough for enzyme to work 

 keep going until all starch has gone ; 

 1 improvement must match one of the errors from 1(c)(i) 

 1(d)(i) 300 (mg) ;;; 3 if answer incorrect one mark for correct unit and one mark for correct working: (3 × 2 × 0.5) ÷ 3 cm^3 is max 2
