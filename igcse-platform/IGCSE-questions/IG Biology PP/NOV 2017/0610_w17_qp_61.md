**1** Fruits such as apples and bananas contain chemicals called polyphenols. An enzyme, polyphenol oxidase, is also present. It catalyses a reaction which converts the polyphenols into brown‑coloured compounds. This reaction happens when the cells are damaged and exposed to oxygen in the air. polyphenols + oxygen 

 polyphenol oxidase brown‑coloured compounds Some students investigated the effect of pH on the enzyme polyphenol oxidase in apples. The students were provided with one apple, distilled water and four solutions labelled B , C , D and E. Each solution had a different pH. Step 1 Five Petri dishes were labelled A , B , C , D and E. Step 2 20 cm^3 of distilled water was added to Petri dish A. Step 3 20 cm^3 of solution B was poured into the Petri dish labelled B. Step 4 Step 3 was repeated using solutions C , D and E and the Petri dishes labelled C , D and E. Step 5 Universal Indicator paper and a pH colour chart were used to find the pH of each of the solutions in the five Petri dishes. Step 6 Six slices were cut from an apple and put on to separate white tiles. The apple slices were cut to approximately the same size. Step 7 Each apple slice was chopped into small pieces and then crushed with a spatula. Step 8 One of the crushed apple slices was put into each of the solutions in Petri dishes A , B , C , D and E. A lid was put on to each of the Petri dishes and they were left for two minutes. Step 9 The crushed apple from the remaining slice was left uncovered, on the white tile and was labelled control. Step 10 The lid of Petri dish A was removed and the liquid was poured away, leaving only the crushed apple in the Petri dish. The Petri dish lid was not replaced. Step 11 Step 10 was repeated for Petri dishes B , C , D and E. Step 12 The students looked at the colour of the crushed apple slice in each Petri dish at 0 minutes, 10 minutes and 20 minutes. The students used the key shown in Table 1.1 to identify the colour intensity value for each crushed apple slice. Table 1.1 colour of the crushed apple slice no brown colour light brown dark brown

**(f)** In another experiment, enzymes were extracted from two different fruits. These enzyme extracts were heated at 65 °C for a total of 60 minutes. During this time samples were removed every 15 minutes. The samples were tested to find out how much enzyme activity remained. Table 1.3 shows the results of the experiment. **Table 1.3**
