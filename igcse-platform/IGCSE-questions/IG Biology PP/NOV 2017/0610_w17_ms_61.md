MARK SCHEME 

Maximum Mark: 40 

 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. 

Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2017 series for most Cambridge IGCSE®, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components.

 1(a)(i) one table drawn with appropriate number of columns ; 

 correct column and row headings with appropriate units (pH and intensity / minutes) ; 

 pH recorded for each solution ; 

 colour of apple slices recorded by intensity for 0 and 10 minutes (numerical values not words) ; 

 colour of apple slices recorded by intensity for 20 minutes (numerical values not words) ; 

 5 I control if added to table 

 R if units in data cell

 1(a)(iii) to compare (what happens to the apple) with the solution and with no solution / at different pH values and no pH / with different pH values and the air / with the solution and with the air ; 

 1 I for comparison unqualified 

 A to see what happens to the crushed apple when it is not exposed to the solution A to observe what would happen without the effect of pH A idea that: the control shows that the liquid (or change in pH) is causing the results (and not the air) 

 1(a)(iv) lemon juice ; 

 has low pH / is acidic / (lemon juice has a pH of 2 and) previous experiment showed that apple won’t go brown at pH2 ; 

 2 A olive oil as keeps out air / oxygen for 2 marks. Olive oil or lemon juice with wrong explanation = 1 mark. Accept enzyme doesn’t work (denatured) at pH2 

1(b)(i) (^) _variable controlled by_ volume / amount / mass, of solution / named solution / liquid adding 20 cm^3 (same / one) apple all slices cut from the same apple time soaking in solution all soaked for 2 mins observation time / time intervals left for 20 min / results checked every 10 minutes

 A time apple was left in the Petri dish A oxygen / air exposure time 

 1(b)(ii) oxygen is needed (from the air) for the reaction ; 1 A to expose the apple to oxygen I air 

 1(b)(iii) using / cutting (with a knife or scalpel) and cutting away from the hand / cutting on a surface ;

 1(c) any 1 from: idea that it is a qualitative / subjective, method / judged by eye / similar browning looks the same / AW ; 

 1 A there are more than three shades of brown 

 1(d) any pair from error improvement amount of apple not the same / cutting inaccurate 

 use same mass / weight / use a set volume of crushed apple 

 crushing uneven use a blender / mortar and pestle 

 idea some may have more time in solution than others 

 test each separately 

 some apple exposed to air while others being crushed 

 test each separately

 4 methodology described e.g. ref to leaving the enzyme and substrate separately to reach a set temperature ; 

 5 ref to constant pH / experiment carried out at the optimum pH ; 

 6 and 7 controlled variables any two from: same concentration of enzyme / same concentration of substrate / same volume of enzyme / same volume of substrate ;; 

 8 leaving for 20 minutes / leaving for a set time / check at stated time intervals ;
