**1** Starch is an important food source that is digested by the enzyme amylase to form the reducing sugar maltose. 

 amylase starch + water maltose 

 You are going to investigate the effect of enzyme concentration on the rate of digestion of starch by amylase. 

 Read all the instructions but DO NOT CARRY THEM OUT until you have drawn a table for your results in the space provided in 1 (a)(i). Put on the gloves and eye protection provided before starting the practical work. 

 Step 1 Label three test-tubes A , B and C. 

 Step 2 Put 5 cm^3 of starch solution into each of test-tubes A , B and C. 

 Step 3 Label another three test-tubes A1 , B1 and C1. 

 Step 4 Put 1 cm^3 of 3% amylase solution into test-tube A1. Put 1 cm^3 of 2% amylase solution into test-tube B1. Put 1 cm^3 of 1% amylase solution into test-tube C1. 

 Step 5 Place all six test-tubes into a water-bath at 60 °C and leave for three minutes. 

 Raise your hand when you are ready for hot water. 

 You will need to maintain the temperature of the water-bath between 55–60 °C during the whole experiment. Raise your hand for more hot water if needed. 

 Step 6 Use a marker pen to divide a dry white tile into three sections and label them A , B and C as shown in Fig. 1.1. 

 Step 7 Drop iodine solution onto the tile to form two rows of 8 drops approximately the same distance apart, in each of the sections A , B and C as shown in Fig. 1.1.

 Step 8 Dip a glass rod into the starch solution in test-tube A to remove some of the solution. Then touch the glass rod onto the surface of the first drop and then the second drop of iodine solution in row 1 on the section of the tile labelled A. Rinse and dry the glass rod. 

 Step 9 Repeat Step 8 using the amylase solution in test-tube A1 and the drops of iodine solution in row 2 on the section of the tile labelled A.

 Step 10 Start a timer. Add the amylase solution in test-tube A1 to the contents of test-tube A. Stir the mixture with a glass rod and immediately remove some of the mixture using the glass rod and touch it onto the surface of the first drop and then the second drop of iodine solution in row 3 on the section of the tile labelled A. Rinse and dry the glass rod. 

 Step 11 After one minute use the glass rod to remove some of the mixture from test-tube A and touch it onto the first drop and then the second drop of iodine solution in row 4 on the section of the tile labelled A. Rinse and dry the glass rod. 

 Step 12 Repeat step 11 for another four minutes or until all the starch has been digested. If starch was still present in row 8, record this in your table as > 5 minutes. 

 Step 13 Repeat steps 8 to 12 for test-tubes B and B1. 

 Step 14 Repeat steps 8 to 12 for test-tubes C and C1. 

 (a) (i) Prepare a table to record your results. 

 The table should include: 

# • the concentration of the amylase solution 

# • the time taken for all the starch to be digested for each enzyme concentration. 

 Record your results in your table as you carry out the practical work.

 (ii) Describe how you decided the time at which all the starch had been digested by the amylase.

 (d) In another experiment some students made starch agar that contained 100 mg per cm^3 of starch. 

 The starch agar was stained using iodine and was then cut into blocks that measured 2 cm × 3 cm × 0.5 cm. 

 (i) Calculate the total mass of starch in each of the blocks of starch agar. 

 Show your working. 

 .......................................................... mg [3] 

 Six small beakers containing 20 cm^3 of 5% amylase solution were placed in water-baths at different temperatures. One of the blocks containing starch from (d)(i) was placed into each of the beakers. 

 The time taken for all the starch to disappear was measured. 

 The results of the experiment are shown in Table 1.1.

 (d) Fig. 2.3 shows the apparatus used to measure water uptake by a leafy shoot. The leafy shoot is sealed tightly into a glass tube which is connected to a capillary tube containing water. 

 As the leafy shoot loses water through its leaves it absorbs water from the apparatus. Air is pulled into the open end of the capillary tube as the water moves towards the leafy shoot. 

 The distance moved by the air in the capillary tube can be measured on the scale and used to calculate the volume of water absorbed by the leafy shoot.
