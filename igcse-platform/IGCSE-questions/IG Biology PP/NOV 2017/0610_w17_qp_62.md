**1** Starch is an important food source that is digested by the enzyme amylase to form the reducingsugar maltose. 

starch + water amylase maltose Some students investigated the effect of enzyme concentration on the rate of digestion of starch. Step 1 Three test-tubes were labelled **A** , **B** and **C**. Step 2 5 cm^3 of starch solution was put into each of test-tubes **A** , **B** and **C**. Step 3 Another three test-tubes were labelled **A1** , **B1** and **C1**. Step 4 1 cm1 cm^33 of 3% amylase solution was put into test-tubeof 2% amylase solution was put into test-tube **A1B1** .. 1 cm^3 of 1% amylase solution was put into test-tube **C1**. Step 5 All six test-tubes were placed into a water-bath at 60 °C for three minutes. Step 6 A white tile was divided into three sections and labelled **A** , **B** and **C** as shown in Fig. 1.1. Step 7 Iodine solution was dropped onto the tile to form two rows of 10 drops approximately the same distance apart, in each of the sections **A** , **B** and **C** as shown in Fig. 1.1. **A B C row 1**

The glass rod Step 9 Stepsolution in row 8 was repeated using the amylase solution in test-tube 2 on the section of the tile labelled A. A1 and the drops of iodine Step 10 A timer was started and the amylase solution in test-tube A1 was poured into test-tube A. The mixture of starch and amylase in test-tubesome of the mixture was immediately removed using the glass rod. A was stirred with a glass rod and then The glass rod was then touched onto the surface of the first drop and then the seconddrop of iodine solution in row 3 on the section of the tile labelled A. The glass rod was rinsed and dried.

 Step 11 After one minute the glass rod was used to remove some of the mixture from test-tube A and touched onto the first drop and then the second drop of the iodine solution in row 4 on the section of the tile labelled A. The glass rod was rinsed and dried. Step 12 Step 11 was repeated for six more minutes. Step 13 Steps 8 to 12 were repeated for test-tubes B and B1. Step 14 Steps 8 to 12 were repeated for test-tubes C and C1. Fig. 1.2 shows the students’ results. A B C row 1

 Fig. 1.2 (a) (i) Prepare a table to record the students’ results. The table should include: 

- the concentration of the amylase solution 

- the time taken for all the starch to be digested for each amylase concentration.

 (d) In another experiment some students made starch agar that contained 100 mg per cm^3 of starch. The starch agar was stained using iodine and was then cut into blocks that measured 2 cm × 3 cm × 0.5 cm. (i) Calculate the total mass of starch in each of the blocks of starch agar. Show your working. 

 ...........................................................mg [3] Six small beakers containing 20 cm^3 of 5% amylase solution were placed in water-baths at different temperatures. One of the blocks containing starch from (d)(i) was placed into each of the beakers. The time taken for all the starch to disappear was measured. The results of the experiment are shown in Table 1.1.

The leafy shoot is sealed tightly into a glass tube which is connected to a capillary tube containing water. As the leafy shoot loses water through its leaves it absorbs water from the apparatus. Air is pulled into the open end of the capillary tube as the water moves towards the leafy shoot. The distance moved by the air in the capillary tube can be measured on the scale and used to calculate the volume of water absorbed by the leafy shoot.
