MARK SCHEME 

Maximum Mark: 40 

 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. 

Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2017 series for most Cambridge IGCSE®, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components.

 1(a)(i) table drawn with minimum two columns and a line between heading and data ; 

 appropriate column / row headings and appropriate units for percentage concentration of amylase time for starch to be digested / minutes ; 

 three correct amylase concentrations recorded (either order) ; 

 three correct timings recorded ; 

 six correct timings recorded ; 

 5 R if units in body of table 

 I units in the body of the table 

 1(a)(ii) drops (for B at 3, 4 and 5 min) have merged / AW ; 

 results for C have different end times ; 

 results for C are different at 3 min ; 

 no repeats ; 

 1 any one from: 

 A at 4 / 5 mins 

 I enzyme will be denatured by high temperature / results qualitative / subjective / no control / human error

 1(b)(i) variable controlled by 

 volume / amount of starch (solution) 

 5 cm^3 / same volume , used in each 

 concentration / amount of starch (solution) 

 same concentration of starch solution / used in each 

 concentration / amount of iodine 

 same iodine solution used in each 

 volume of enzyme / amylase 

 1 cm^3 used 

 temperature (maintained at) 60°C 

 time 3 minutes for equilibration / testing for, 7 / 8 / 9 / 10, minutes ; ; 

 2 one mark for the variable, one mark for method of controlling which must related 

 I amount of enzyme 

 I same temperature 

 1(b)(ii) so the contents of all the test-tubes reach the same temperature / AW ;

 1(c)(i) idea of judging the colour of the endpoint by eye ; 

 idea of doing several procedures at the same time ; 

 idea of using one drop for both spots of iodine ; 

 idea that 1 drop for both spots (could cause contamination) ; 

 idea of: two samples needed at the same time with the same rod, (then there will be a difference in the actual time) ; 

 idea of: size of drops (from either starch or iodine) added varies ; 

## 2 

 1(c)(ii) e.g. of error improvement 

 judging colour by eye have a standard colour for comparison / use colorimeter 

 timing and sampling at same time 

 start timer then mix and sample and note time when samples taken / AW 

 one drop for two samples / one glass rod 

 use two rods / pipette 

 contamination use two rods / pipette 

 two samples at the same time 

 use two glass rods or do trials separately 

 drop size (for either iodine of drop from glass rod) 

 use a pipette / syringe
