**Read through all the questions on this paper carefully before starting work. 1** Urine is a waste product released from the body. It contains urea, water, salts and other metabolic wastes. You are going to investigate the chemicals present in different samples of urine. You are provided with three samples of urine labelled **A** , **B** and **C**. These samples have been made up in the laboratory to represent urine. **(a)** Complete Table 1.1 to describe the appearance of the three samples. **Table 1.1** sample appearance **A** 

 B C [3] (b) Urine is often tested as part of a medical health check. Two common tests are described below. Test 1 Pour a small volume of the urine sample into a test-tube. Add approximately the same volume of biuret reagent to the test-tube. Observe any colour change. Test 2 Pour a small volume of the urine sample into a test-tube. Add approximately the same volume of Benedict’s solution to the test-tube. Heat the test-tube in a water-bath. Observe any colour change.

 You are going to carry out both of these tests on the three urine samples A , B and C. You will carry out six tests in total. (i) Prepare a table to record your observations in the space below. 

## [3] 

 (ii) Use the equipment provided to carry out Test 1 and Test 2 on each sample A , B , and C. Raise your hand when you are ready for a supply of hot water for your water-bath in Test 2. Record your observations in your table. [3]

 (c) The results of urine tests can be used to suggest whether a person has a health problem. Assume samples A , B and C were collected from three different people during a medical health check. If reducing sugar is present, the person may be suffering from a disease called diabetes. If protein is present, the person may be suffering from kidney problems. However, if reducing sugar and protein are both absent from the urine, the person is likely to be healthy. Use this information and your results to make and explain a conclusion about the health of each of these three people.

 (d) Suggest two sources of error with these tests. For each error, describe how you could improve the method to decrease the effect of the error. error 1 ....................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... improvement 1 .......................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... error 2 ....................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... improvement 2 .......................................................................................................................... ...................................................................................................................................................

 (e) One of the functions of the kidney is to reabsorb glucose back into the blood. Table 1.2 shows the relationship between the glucose concentration in the blood and the amount of glucose excreted in the urine. Table 1.2 blood glucose concentration / mg per 100 cm 3 glucose excreted in urine / mg per minute 0 0 100 0 200 0 300 40 400 100 500 190 600 280 700 370

**2** You are provided with half of a flower labelled **F**. Carefully remove the plastic film. Use the hand lens to observe the male and female parts in the centre of the half-flower. **(a)** Draw a large, labelled diagram of your half-flower. Your diagram should show the arrangement of the male and female parts.

 (d) Flowers produce a sugar solution so that a pollen tube can grow. A student was planning an investigation to find out how the concentration of sugar solution might affect the rate of growth of pollen tubes.
