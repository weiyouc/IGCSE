**Read through all of the questions on this paper carefully before starting work.** 

**You should wear the eye protection provided during the practical work in question 1.** 

**1** You are provided with some fresh milk, labelled **milk**. 

 (a) You are going to test the milk for protein. 

 (i) State the reagent you will use to test the milk for protein. 

 .......................................................................................................................................[1] 

 (ii) Carry out the test for protein on approximately 2 cm 3 of the milk. 

 Observe and record any colour change. State a conclusion from your observations. 

 colour change ....................................................................................................................

 (iii) You are expected to wear eye protection for this test. State one other safety procedure you should follow. 

 ........................................................................................................................................... 

 .......................................................................................................................................[1] 

 (b) You are going to investigate the effect of an enzyme on the milk. 

 This enzyme is found in the stomach of young mammals. It causes milk to form insoluble clots. This makes the milk easier to digest. 

 You are provided with an enzyme solution, labelled enzyme. 

- Label a clean large test-tube, **No X**. 

- Add 5 cm^3 of fresh milk into the large test-tube **No X**. 

- Stand large test-tube **No X** in a beaker of water at 40 °C for one minute. 

- Add 1 cm^3 of the enzyme solution to the milk in the large test-tube **No X**. 

- Start timing. 

- Gently tilt and roll the large test-tube as shown in Fig. 1.1. You can remove the large     test-tube from the water to do this. This should form a film of milk on the inside of the     large test-tube.

 Fig. 1.1 

- Roll the large test-tube continuously until stage **C** is reached and clots are formed, as     shown in Fig. 1.1 and Fig. 1.2. If it takes longer than three minutes for clots to form, stop     rolling the large test-tube and continue with the rest of question **(b)**.

- Record the time taken for clots to form in minutes and seconds. If more than three     minutes, record your time as ‘more than three minutes’.

 (c) You are going to investigate how chemical X affects the speed of the clotting process. 

 You are provided with two different concentrations of solution X. These are labelled X1 and X2. 

 You will add each of these solutions in turn to a mixture of milk and enzyme and record how long it takes for clots to form in the milk. 

 Prepare a table to record your results. Your table should include your results for No X as well as for X1 and X2.

- Label two clean large test-tubes **X1** and **X2**. 

- Add 5 cm^3 of fresh milk into each of the large test-tubes. 

- Raise your hand for a fresh supply of water at 40 °C. 

- Stand the test-tubes in the beaker of water at 40 °C for one minute. 

- Add 5 cm^3 of solution **X1** to the large test-tube labelled **X1**. 

- Add 1 cm^3 of the enzyme solution to the large test-tube **X1**. 

- Start timing. 

- Gently tilt and roll the large test-tube as before. Roll the large test-tube continuously until     clots begin to form, as shown at stage **C** in Fig. 1.1. 

- Repeat this procedure using solution **X2**. 

- Record the times taken for the milk to clot in large test-tubes **X1** and **X2** in your results     table.        [5] 

 (d) Using your results, describe the pattern shown.

 Suggest why this is important.

 (g) Enzymes usually have a pH at which they work fastest. This is called the optimum pH.

 (b) A group of students investigated the rate of transpiration from four leaves. 

 They covered different surfaces of the leaves with petroleum jelly. Petroleum jelly creates a waterproof barrier. 

 They then measured the mass of each leaf. 

 The leaves were left hanging from a piece of string in a warm place for 24 hours. 

 The students then measured the mass of each leaf again. 

 Table 2.1 shows their results.
