## This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements ofthe examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does notindicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal ExaminerReport for Teachers.Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2015 series for most^ 0610/61^ Paper 6 (Alternative to Practical), maximum raw mark 40

 Answer^ 

 Mark^ Comments (iv)^ any 3 from:^ below optimum pH^ /^ pH4 – as pH increases (from pH3–4)the activity increases ;above optimum pH^ /^ pH4 – as pH increases (from pH4–8)the activity decreases ;use of calculated data ;reference to gradient^ /^ AW ; 

 A^ below optimum pH, activity decreasesmax [3] 

 /^ time increases^ /^ rate decreases A^ above optimum pH, time increases 

 /^ rate decreases A ora^ as pH decreases from 8–4 the activityincreasese.g. between pH3 and 4 the time is 3.6 

 minutes less and between pH4 and 5 the time is 0.3 

 minutes more. Not just quoting figures. A^ gradient is steeper before pH4^ /^ gradient is lesssteep after pH4 (c)^ (i)^ any two from:^ fresh enzyme^ /^ temperature 

 /^ amount of agitation or shakingof test-tubes / same concentration or volume ofenzyme / same concentration or volume of starch solution ;;
