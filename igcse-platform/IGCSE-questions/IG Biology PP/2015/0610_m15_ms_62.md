## CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL EXAMINATIONS Cambridge International General Certificate of Secondary Education MARK SCHEME for the March 2015 series 

# This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements ofthe examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does notindicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal ExaminerReport for Teachers.^ 0610/62^ Paper 6 (Alternative to Practical), maximum raw mark 40^ 0610 BIOLOGY 

Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the March 2015 series for most Cambridge IGCSE components. ®
