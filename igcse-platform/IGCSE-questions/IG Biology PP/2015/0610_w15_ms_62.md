It does notindicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal ExaminerReport for Teachers.Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2015 series for most^ 0610/62^ Paper 6 (Alternative to Practical), maximum raw mark 40
