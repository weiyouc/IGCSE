BIOLOGY Paper 5 Practical Test MARK SCHEMEMaximum Mark: 40 Cambridge International Examinations^ Cambridge International General Certificate of Secondary Education May/June 20160610/53 This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of theexamination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate thedetails of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would haveconsidered the acceptability of alternative answers.Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report forTeachers.Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.^ Published Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2016 series for most Cambridge IGCSECambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components. ®,

 /^ holes made in the cardboard/moreholes in the lid with the ears ; water volume not measured ; squeeze rate not consistent / defined^ ; difficult to measure both times simultaneously^ ; explain heat may be lost through gaps^ /^ more holes so greater heat loss^
