**1** Grapes are soft fruits that contain sugars. Some students investigated the concentration of reducing sugars in grapes. **(a)** Step 1 The students determined the volume of the grapes by placing 50 cm^3 of distilled water into a measuring cylinder. Step 2 Four grapes were placed into the measuring cylinder and the total volume of the distilled water and grapes was measured. Fig. 1.1 shows the total volume of the distilled water and grapes in the measuring cylinder.

 (ii) Calculate the average volume of one grape using your answer to 1(a)(i). Space for working. 

 .................................................. cm^3 [1] Step 3 Three test-tubes were labelled, S1 , S2 and S3. Step 4 5.0 cm^3 of a sugar solution ( S ) was added to test-tube S1. Step 5 1.0 cm^3 of solution S and 4.0 cm^3 of distilled water were added to test-tube S2. The contents of S2 were mixed. Step 6 0.2 cm^3 of solution S and 4.8 cm^3 of distilled water were added to test-tube S3. The contents of S3 were mixed. Step 7 Grape juice was extracted from ten grapes. Step 8 5.0 cm^3 of the extracted grape juice was placed into a test-tube labelled G. Step 9 5.0 cm^3 of Benedict’s solution was added S1 ,to S2 , S3 each and G .of test-tu Step 10 Test-tubes S1 , S2 , S3 and G were placed into an 80 °C water-bath. Step 11 The time at which a colour change first appeared in each test-tube was recorded. Step 12 Steps 3 to 11 were repeated to obtain a second set of results.

 (d) Grapes develop in large groups attached to their parent plant. As they develop, grapes increase in size and ripen. Fig. 1.3 shows one group of grapes. 

 Fig. 1.3 A student suggested that the concentration of reducing sugars in grapes changed as the grapes developed and ripened. Describe how the method used in steps 3 to 12 could be modified to determine if there is a change in the concentration of reducing sugars in grapes during development. ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ...............................................................................................................................................[2]

 (b) Some students measured the average increase in chest circumference, during breathing, when at rest. Each student wrapped a tape measure around their body just below the armpits, as shown in Fig. 2.2. 

 Fig. 2.2 Each student then breathed out and took a measurement of their chest circumference. They then breathed in and took a second measurement. The difference between the two measurements is the increase in chest circumference. Table 2.1 shows the results of their measurements.
