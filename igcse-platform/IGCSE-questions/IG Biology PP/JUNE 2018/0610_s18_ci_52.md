 Paper 5 Practical Test May/June 2018 CONFIDENTIAL INSTRUCTIONS Great care should be taken to ensure that any confidential information given does not reach the candidates either directly or indirectly.

## READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST 

These Confidential Instructions give details of the apparatus required by each candidate for each experiment in this paper. A summary of the questions that will be presented to the candidates is included, where appropriate, to allow the biology teacher to test the apparatus appropriately. **Testing must be done out of sight of all candidates.** 

**No access to the question paper is permitted in advance of the examination.** 

Centres are reminded that candidates are expected to follow the instructions on the question paper and record all their results. They will not be penalised if these results are not what they expect. 

The Supervisor should make sure the Supervisor’s Report is fully completed and a copy is enclosed with each packet of scripts. 

It is assumed that the ordinary apparatus of a science laboratory will be available, including a supply of purified water (distilled or deionised). 

If arrangements are made for different sessions for different groups of candidates, care must be taken to ensure that the different groups of candidates are effectively isolated so that **no information passes between them**. 

**All specimens should carry only the code letters and numbers as indicated and their identity should not be revealed to the candidates.** 

Supervisors should ensure that all specimens have the correct identity attached to the specimen and that these are **not** removed during the examination. 

If a candidate breaks any of the apparatus, or loses any of the material supplied, the matter should be rectified and a note made in the Supervisor’s Report. 

Supervisors are advised to remind candidates that **all** substances in the examination should be treated with caution. Pipette fillers and suitable eye protection should be used where necessary. 

In accordance with COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) Regulations, operative in the UK, a hazard appraisal of the examination has been carried out. 

The following codes are used where relevant: 

**C** corrosive **MH** moderate hazard 

**HH** health hazard **T** acutely toxic 

**F** flammable **O** oxidising 

**N** hazardous to the aquatic environment 

Centres are reminded that they are **not** permitted to open the question paper envelopes before the examination. 

If there are any difficulties with any aspect of setting up this practical examination that the Centre is not able to resolve, it is essential for Centres to contact Cambridge as soon as possible by **email** to info@ cie.org.uk, by **fax** to +44 1223 553558 or by **phone** to +44 1223 553554.

**Question 1** 

Each candidate should be provided with: 

 (i) two standard test-tubes (125 × 15 mm) (The standard test-tubes must be able to fit inside the large test-tubes when inverted.) 

 (ii) two large test-tubes (150 × 25 mm) 

 (iii) one empty 250 cm^3 beaker labelled warm 

 (iv) one 250 cm^3 beaker labelled cool containing approximately 200 cm^3 of water at 20 °C 

 (v) waterproof pen (fine tip) for writing on glass 

 (vi) 80 cm^3 of active yeast suspension (not including foam) in a beaker with a pouring lip, labelled yeast suspension 

 (vii) a supply of water at 45 °C (approximately 200 cm^3 ), to be distributed to candidates when they put their hand up 

 (viii) thermometer 

 (ix) 30 cm ruler with a mm scale 

 (x) timer 

 (xi) paper towels 

 (xii) gloves 

 Preparation of solutions 

 Yeast suspension 

 Add 50 g of fast-acting yeast and 10 g of sucrose (table sugar) to 500 cm^3 of warm water (35–40 °C) and stir to mix. Add more warm water to make up to 1 dm^3. Ensure that the yeast suspension is active and producing foam before giving it to candidates. Skim the foam from the top of the suspension before giving it to candidates. 

 The yeast suspension should be made on the day of the examination. Before the examination it is recommended that centres trial how long it takes for the yeast to become active (producing foam) as some yeasts require more time. 

**Question 2** 

 (i) 30 cm ruler with mm scale 

 The Supervisor ( not the invigilator) should carry out the practical aspects of Question 1 and record their results in the space in the Supervisor’s Report. This must be done during the examination, using the same apparatus as the candidates but out of sight of the candidates.
