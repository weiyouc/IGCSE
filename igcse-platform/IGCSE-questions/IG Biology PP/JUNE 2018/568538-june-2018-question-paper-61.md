**1** Young mammals feed on milk containing protein. Some mammals produce an enzyme called rennin. Rennin changes the protein in milk so that it can be digested by another enzyme. The action of rennin causes small lumps or clots to form in the milk. An investigation was carried out to find the effect of pH on the activity of the enzyme rennin. Step 1 Three test-tubes were labelled **P** , **Q** and **R**. Step 2 A syringe was used to add 5 cm 3 of milk to each of these test-tubes. Step 3 A dropping pipette was used to add two drops of acid to test-tube **P**. Step 4 A dropping pipette was used to add two drops of distilled water to test-tube **Q**. Step 5 A dropping pipette was used to add two drops of alkali to test-tube **R**. Step 6 Another three test-tubes were labelled **P1** , **Q1** and **R1**. Step 7 A clean syringe was used to add 1 cm^3 of 0.1% rennin solution to each of test-tubes **P1** , **Q1** and **R1**. Step 8 All six test-tubes were placed into a water-bath at 40 °C and left for three minutes. Step 9 The contents of test-tube **P1** were added to test-tube **P**. The contents of test-tube **Q1** were added to test-tube **Q**. The contents of test-tube **R1** were added to test-tube **R**. Step 10 Test-tubes **P** , **Q** and **R** were kept in the water-bath and a stop-clock was started. Step 11 After one minute, test-tube **P** was removed from the water-bath. It was tipped and rotated as shown in Fig. 1.1. The appearance of the milk was observed, and the stage of clotting was decided by comparing it to the diagrams in Fig. 1.1. 

 stage A no clotting stage B some clotting 

 stage C all clotted 

 milk drains back smoothly from the sides of the test-tube 

 small clots stick to the sides of the test-tube 

 most of the milk is solid and does not pour when the test-tube is tipped 

 Fig. 1.1 Step 12 Test-tube P was returned to the water-bath. Step 13 Steps 11 and 12 were repeated for test-tubes Q and R. Step 14 Steps 11, 12 and 13 were repeated every minute for five minutes.

 The results are shown in Fig. 1.2. Test-tube P had some clotting at one minute and was all clotted at two minutes. Test-tube Q had no clotting at one, two or three minutes but some clotting at four and five minutes. Test-tube R had no clotting throughout the investigation, and remained unchanged after five minutes. Fig. 1.2 (a) Prepare a table in which to record these results. Use the information in Fig. 1.2 to complete this table.

 (f) Clotting separates milk into a solid part and a liquid part.

**2** A student wanted to investigate a garden ecosystem. She counted the number of insects caught in spider webs in one small section of the garden. She found six spider webs in the small section of garden sampled. Diagrams of the spider webs are shown in Fig. 2.1. Each black dot represents one insect caught in a spider web.
