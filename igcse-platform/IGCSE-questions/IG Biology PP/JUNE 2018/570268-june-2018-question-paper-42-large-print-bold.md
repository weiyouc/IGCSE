4 One of the roles of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, US, is to try to reduce the number of people who are infected with pathogens. The CDC conducted a survey. They asked women which, if any, contraceptive methods they used. (a) Suggest why the CDC collected data on contraceptive methods. __________________________________________ __________________________________________ __________________________________________ __________________________________________ __________________________________________ __________________________________________ _______________________________________ [3]
