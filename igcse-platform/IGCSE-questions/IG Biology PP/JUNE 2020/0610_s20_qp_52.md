**1** You are going to investigate the effect of temperature on diffusion. Dialysis tubing is used to represent a cell membrane. Cell membranes are partially permeable. **Read all of the instructions but DO NOT CARRY THEM OUT until you have drawn a table for your results in the space provided in 1(a)(i).** You should wear the gloves and eye protection provided during the practical work. Step 1 Label one test-tube **C** and the other test-tube **H**. Draw a small **X** on the outside of both test-tubes approximately half-way down each test-tube as shown in Fig. 1.1.

 Fig. 1.1 Step 2 You are provided with two lengths of dialysis tubing which have been knotted at one end to form a bag. The bags can be opened by rubbing the unknotted end between two fingers. Step 3 Use a pipette to put starch suspension into one of the opened dialysis tubing bags. Keep adding the starch suspension until the dialysis tubing bag is approximately three-quarters full. Step 4 It is important that the starch suspension does not spill onto the outside of the dialysis tubing bag. Fill a 10 cm^3 syringe with distilled water. Hold the dialysis tubing bag containing starch over the container labelled waste and use the syringe to carefully wash the outside of the bag with the distilled water. Step 5 Place the dialysis tubing bag containing starch suspension into test-tube C. Fold the open end of the dialysis tubing over the top of the test-tube. Secure with an elastic band approximately 2 cm from the top of the test-tube as shown in Fig. 1.2. Place test-tube C in the test-tube rack.

Step 10 Use a syringe to add 1 cm^3 of iodine solution to the water in each test-tube. Step 11 Start the stop-clock. Step 12 Observe the crosses on the test-tubes by looking through the dialysis tubing as shown inFig. 1.3.

**2** A student investigated the effect of different concentrations of sugar solution on osmosis in potato sticks. The student used this method: 

- cut six potato sticks 

- measure the initial mass of each potato stick 

- place each potato stick in a different concentration of sugar solution 

- leave the potato sticks in the sugar solutions for one hour 

- after one hour remove the potato sticks and measure the final mass of each potato stick. **(a) (i)** All of the potato sticks were left in the sugar solutions for the same length of time. State **two** other variables that the student should have kept constant during their investigation. 1 ........................................................................................................................................ 2 ........................................................................................................................................
