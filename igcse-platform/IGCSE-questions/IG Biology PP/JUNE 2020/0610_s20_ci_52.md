## General information about practical exams 

Centres must follow the guidance on science practical exams given in the _Cambridge Handbook_. 

### Safety 

Supervisors must follow national and local regulations relating to safety and first aid. 

Only those procedures described in the question paper should be attempted. 

Supervisors must inform candidates that materials and apparatus used in the exam should be treated with caution. Suitable eye protection should be used where necessary. 

The following hazard codes are used in these confidential instructions, where relevant: 

 C corrosive MH moderate hazard HH health hazard T acutely toxic F flammable O oxidising N hazardous to the aquatic environment 

Hazard data sheets relating to substances used in this exam should be available from your chemical supplier. 

### Before the exam 

● The packets containing the question papers must **not** be opened before the exam. ● It is assumed that standard school laboratory facilities, as indicated in the _Guide to Planning Practical Science_ , will be available. ● Spare materials and apparatus for the tasks set must be available for candidates, if required. 

### During the exam 

● It must be made clear to candidates at the start of the exam that they may request spare materials and apparatus for the tasks set. ● Where specified, the supervisor **must** perform the experiments and record the results as instructed. This must be done **out of sight** of the candidates, using the same materials and apparatus as the candidates. ● Any assistance provided to candidates must be recorded in the supervisor’s report. ● If any materials or apparatus need to be replaced, for example, in the event of breakage or loss, this must be recorded in the supervisor’s report. 

### After the exam 

● The supervisor must complete a report for each practical session held and each laboratory used. ● Each packet of scripts returned to Cambridge International must contain the following items: 

 ● the scripts of the candidates specified on the bar code label provided ● the supervisor’s results relevant to these candidates ● the supervisor’s reports relevant to these candidates ● seating plans for each practical session, referring to each candidate by candidate number ● the attendance register.

## Specific information for this practical exam 

 During the exam, the supervisor (NOT the invigilator) must do the experiment in Question 1 and record their results on a spare copy of the question paper, clearly labelled ‘supervisor’s results’. 

**Question 1** 

Each candidate should be provided with: 

 hazard materials and apparatus Quantity per candidate 

 dialysis tubing bags provided in a small beaker of distilled water labelled dialysis tubing bags^2 

 2% starch suspension provided in a small beaker labelled starch 100 cm^3 

 iodine solution in a small beaker labelled iodine solution 20 cm 3 

 large test-tubes (150 mm × 25 mm) 2 

 elastic bands to fit around the top of a large test-tube 2 

 30 cm transparent plastic ruler with mm measurements (also required for question 2) 1 

 1 cm 3 dropping pipette 1 

 1 cm^3 syringe 1 

 10 cm 3 syringe 1 

 distilled water in a beaker, at room temperature, labelled distilled water 200 cm^ 

 3 

 empty 250 cm 3 beaker labelled waste 1 

 test-tube rack 1 

 a supply of water at 50 °C Candidates will raise their hand when they are ready for hot water. 

 100 cm 3 

 empty 250 cm 3 beaker labelled hot water 1 

 stop-clock 1

 Preparation of solutions 

 2% starch suspension 

 To prepare the starch suspension add 2 g of soluble starch to 10 cm 3 of distilled water, shake well, and make up to a total volume of 100 cm^3 by adding distilled water. Stir thoroughly and boil for one minute or until the suspension becomes clear. Leave to cool. 

 The starch suspension can be made the day before the exam and stored in a refrigerator. The starch suspension should be provided to candidates at room temperature. 

 iodine solution 

 A commercially prepared iodine solution suitable for food tests can be used. 

 dialysis tubing bags 

 Dialysis tubing comes in a variety of widths. Use dialysis tubing that will fit into a large test-tube when the tubing contains 10 cm^3 of liquid. The dialysis tubing bags may be prepared the day before the exam but must be kept submerged in distilled water. 

 Prepare the dialysis tubing by soaking 20 cm lengths of dialysis tubing in distilled water for 10 minutes. Knot one end of the damp dialysis tubing tightly to form a bag. The distance of the knot from the open end of the dialysis tubing should be approximately 17 cm. 

 The dialysis tubing bags should be presented to candidates in a small beaker of distilled water labelled dialysis tubing bags.
