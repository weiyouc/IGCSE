**1** A student investigated the effect of temperature on diffusion. Dialysis tubing was used to represent a cell membrane. Cell membranes are partially permeable. Step 1 One test-tube was labelled **C** and another test-tube was labelled **H**. The student drew a small **X** on the outside of each test-tube as shown in Fig. 1.1. **C H**

 Fig. 1.1 Step 2 The student was given two pieces of dialysis tubing. A knot was tied at one end of each piece of dialysis tubing to form two bags. Step 3 Starch suspension was put into each dialysis tubing bag until each bag was approximately three-quarters full. Step 4 One of the dialysis tubing bags containing starch suspension was put into test-tube C. The open end of the dialysis tubing was folded over the top of the test-tube. It was secured with an elastic band as shown in Fig. 1.2. open end of the dialysis tubing bag folded over the top of the test-tube

 Step 5 Step 4 was repeated with the other dialysis tubing bag and test-tube H. Step 6 Cold water was added to test-tube C until it reached the level of the elastic band. Step 7 Hot water was added to test-tube H until it reached the level of the elastic band. Step 8 The temperatures of the water in test-tube C and test-tube H were measured. The temperatures are shown on the sections of thermometers in Fig. 1.3.

 Fig. 1.3 Step 9 1 cm 3 of iodine solution was added to the water in each test-tube. Step 10 A stop-clock was started. Step 11 The student observed the X on each test-tube by looking through the dialysis tubing bags as shown in Fig. 1.4.

 Step 12 The student continued to observe the X until the contents of the dialysis tubing bag became blue-black in colour. At this point the X was no longer visible. The student recorded the time taken for the X to stop being visible in each test-tube. The student’s results are shown in Fig. 1.5.

**2** A student investigated the effect of different concentrations of sugar solution on osmosis in potato sticks. The student used this method: 

- cut six potato sticks 

- measure the initial mass of each potato stick 

- place each potato stick in a different concentration of sugar solution 

- leave the potato sticks in the sugar solutions for one hour 

- after one hour remove the potato sticks and measure the final mass of each potato stick. **(a) (i)** All of the potato sticks were left in the sugar solutions for the same length of time.     State **two** other variables that the student should have kept constant during their     investigation.     1 ........................................................................................................................................     2 ........................................................................................................................................
