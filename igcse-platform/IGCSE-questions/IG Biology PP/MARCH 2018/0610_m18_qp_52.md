**1** You are going to investigate the effect of temperature on water uptake in celery stalks. Water is transported in the xylem tissue of plant stems. **Read all the instructions but DO NOT CARRY THEM OUT until you have drawn a table for your results in the space provided in 1(a)(i).** You are provided with two celery stalks of the same length and two small beakers that contain a red stain. Step 1 Place one of the small beakers containing red stain into the large beaker labelled **cool**. Place the other small beaker containing red stain into the large beaker labelled **warm**. The large beakers will act as water-baths. Step 2 Raise your hand when you are ready for water to be added to the two water-baths. Add ice water to the **cool** water-bath and warm water to the **warm** water-bath. Make sure that the water in the water-baths does not go into the small beakers of red stain. Step 3 Leave the small beakers containing the red stain in the water-baths for 3 minutes. Step 4 After 3 minutes, put one celery stalk into each beaker of red stain and leave them in the water-baths for 10 minutes. Step 5 Label one white tile **cool** and the other white tile **warm**. You can continue with other questions during this time. Step 6 After 10 minutes remove the celery stalk from the **warm** beaker of red stain and place it on the tile labelled **warm**. Remove the celery stalk from the **cool** beaker of red stain and place it on the tile labelled **cool**. Step 7 On the tile labelled **warm** , cut a section across the celery stalk, 5 mm from the end that was in the red stain, as shown in Fig. 1.1. section cut in this direction end that was in the red stain 

 Fig. 1.1 Step 8 Use a hand lens to see if the red stain is visible in the xylem of the cut section of the celery stalk. Fig. 1.2 shows the location of the xylem tissue in a cut section of a celery stalk. xylem tissue

 Step 9 If the red stain is visible, cut another 5 mm section from the celery stalk. Step 10 Repeat steps 8 and 9 until you cut a section in which the red stain is not visible. Step 11 Count the number of 5 mm sections you have cut and record this number in your table in 1(a)(i). Step 12 Repeat steps 7 to 11 with the other celery stalk on the tile labelled cool. (a) (i) Prepare a table and record your results in your table, in the space provided. Your table should include: 

# • the temperature (cool or warm) of the red stain 

# • the number of sections that were stained in 10 minutes 

# • the total distance moved by the red stain in 10 minutes.

 (ii) Use your data to calculate the rate of movement of the red stain in the celery stalk at each temperature. Space for working.

[2] (c) One way of improving the method used in this investigation would be to repeat it a number of times. Identify two other sources of error in this investigation. For each error, suggest an improvement to minimise the effect of the error. error 1 ....................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... improvement 1 .......................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... error 2 ....................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... improvement 2 .......................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ...................................................................................................................................................

 (d) Some farmers wanted to investigate the effect of humidity on the rate of transpiration in celery plants. Fig. 1.3 shows a celery plant being harvested. 

 Fig. 1.3 One method of measuring the rate of transpiration is to record how long it takes a red stain to travel up the xylem tissue in a celery stalk that still has its leaves attached. Plan an investigation to determine the effect of humidity on the rate of movement of waterthrough leafy celery stalks. ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ...............................................................................................................................................[6] [Total: 19]

 (ii) The diameter of the bronchus in Fig. 2.1 is shown by the line AB. Measure the length of AB on Fig. 2.1. Include the units. length of AB on Fig. 2.1 ............................................. The actual diameter of the bronchus in Fig. 2.1 is 1.5 mm. The magnification of the bronchus in Fig. 2.1 can be calculated using the following equation:

 (b) A student investigated the effect of exercise on breathing rate. The breathing rates of five people were measured at rest and after running for different periods of time. The people rested between each period of running. The results are shown in Table 2.1. Table 2.1
