MARK SCHEME 

Maximum Mark: 90 

 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. 

Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2018 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components.

 Generic Marking Principles 

These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. 

## GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: 

 Marks must be awarded in line with: 

  the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question  the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question  the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. 

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: 

 Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). 

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: 

 Marks must be awarded positively : 

  marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate  marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do  marks are not deducted for errors  marks are not deducted for omissions  answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. 

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: 

 Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. 


## PUBLISHED 

## GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: 

Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). 

GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: 

Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

 1(b) Explain, using information from the extract, two reasons for falling oil prices. 

 Saudi Arabia’s output of oil is growing (1) increasing the supply / shown on accurate diagram (1). (Global) demand for oil is weak/decreasing / shown on accurate diagram (1) due to global economic uncertainty / competition from renewable energy / price reduced to attract consumers (1). 

## 4 

1(c) (^) **Identify, using information from the extract, two ways a central bank could try to stop a fall in the international value of its currency.** Increase interest rate (1). Sell its foreign reserves / buy its own currency (1). 

## 2 

1(d) (^) **Explain, using information from the extract, two reasons for Russia’s declining population.** High death rate (1) e.g. low life expectancy / poor health of the population / poor healthcare system (1). Low fertility rate (1) e.g. low birth rate / birth rates below the replacement rate (1). High levels of emigration (1) e.g. better opportunities elsewhere, unemployment, poverty, domestic political, social, and economic instability (1).

**Question Answer Marks Guidance** 

 1(e) Analyse the extent to which a rise in oil prices will cause inflation. 

 Rise in oil prices will increase costs of production (1) e.g. higher energy costs / transport costs (1) resulting in cost-push inflation (1). Demand for oil is price-inelastic (1) if prices rise most consumers will keep buying it (1) some producers and consumers however may switch to other products (1) The extent will depend upon the proportion of oil costs in the total costs of other products (1) other costs may be falling (1). Because of rising oil prices, workers may demand higher wages (1) causing cost-push inflation (1). Movements in exchange rates will affect the impact on inflation (1) a rise in the exchange rate would reduce the overall effect (1). For oil producing countries export revenue may rise (1) causing higher demand (1) and demand-pull inflation (1).

**Question Answer Marks Guidance** 

 1(f) Discuss whether or not increasing taxes on Russian oil producers will be harmful to those producers. 

 Up to 3 marks for reasons why it would be harmful: Producers’ costs will rise (1) they will become less profitable (1) and they already struggled to make a profit (1) small producers will find it difficult to absorb the extra costs (1). They may need to cut production / stop production completely (1) or cut costs (1) causing unemployment of the workforce (1). They might pass on the tax (1) by raising prices (1) to maintain profits (1) but this could reduce demand (1) by making them less competitive with other countries e.g. Saudi Arabia (1) less competitive with other energies e.g. renewables (1) Investments in the oil industry may fall (1) due to less funds available (1). 

 Up to 3 marks for reasons why it would not be harmful: Demand for oil is likely to be price inelastic (1) this may enable the producers to pass on the tax in higher price to consumers (1) without losing revenue (1). Most oil producers are large (1) and earn very high profits (1) paying extra tax will not harm them significantly (1). Some of the tax revenue may be used on e.g. education/training (1) which could increase productivity of workers (1) lowering oil producer’s costs (1). 

 5 Each point may be credited only once, on either side of an argument, but separate development as to how/why the outcome may differ is to be rewarded. 

1(g) (^) **Identify one way in which monetary policy differs from fiscal policy.** Fiscal policy includes taxes / government spending (1) monetary policy includes interest rates / money supply / exchange rate (1). Fiscal policy is conducted by the government of the country (1) while monetary policy is conducted by the central bank of the country (1). **2** Maximum 1 mark for reference to only monetary OR fiscal.

 1(h) Discuss whether or not the Russian government should have been concerned about the state of the Russian economy in 2016. 

 Up to 4 marks for why they should have been concerned: Negative economic growth / recession (1) increasing unemployment (1) increasing poverty rates (1) possible policy measures to reduce poverty (1) e.g. costs of healthcare may rise (1) need for greater spending on benefits e.g. unemployment benefits (1) falling tax revenues (1) may have to increase taxes (1) opportunity cost(s) involved / reduced spending on other areas e.g. defence (1). Rising inflation (1) making goods and services less affordable (1). Emigration from Russia is increasing (1) reducing the available workforce (1). Export values are falling (1) so less foreign currency is earned (1) falling value of the rouble (1) causing imported inflation (1) leading to higher interest rates (1) higher cost of borrowing for government (1). Investors lacked confidence in the Russian economy (1) may have reduced productive potential (1). 

 Up to 4 marks for why it is less of a cause for concern: Government spending may not need to rise (1) and tax revenue may increase (1). Domestic consumption is increasing (1) and domestic investment is increasing (1) this may create employment (1) and offset decreases in foreign investments and exports (1) therefore total (aggregate) demand might not decrease significantly (1). Inflation may be a sign of increasing demand (1) showing confidence in the economy (1). Emigration may be mainly of unskilled workers (1) who are less valuable to firms (1). The falling exchange rate may improve the current account (1) with no need for government / central bank action (1).

 2(d) Discuss whether or not protectionism is effective in raising living standards. 

 Up to 5 marks on how it will be effective in raising living standards: Protectionism may increase the price of imports (1) the quantity of imports demanded will decrease (1) the quantity of domestic goods demanded may increase (1) demand for labour is derived demand (1) demand for workers will increase (1), therefore unemployment decreases (1) domestic incomes increase (1) consumption of goods and services increase (1) employment in infant/declining (sunrise/sunset) industries may be protected (1). Increased demand for products of domestic firms may lead to an increase in total revenue (1) and profits (1). Protectionism can decrease imports of demerit goods (1) reducing external costs (1) e.g. pollution, health/social problems (1). 

 Up to 5 marks on how it will not be effective in raising living standards: Protectionism may reduce the possibility of specialisation (1) to produce what a country is best at (1) increasing production costs (1) increasing import prices (1). Protectionism might lead to retaliation (1) other countries may adopt protectionist policies on imports (1) increasing the price of the country’s exports (1) decreasing the demand for exports (1) reducing the demand for workers (1) unemployment increases (1) less income (1) consumption/production of goods and services decreases (1). Protectionism may reduce competition / choices available to domestic consumers (1) reducing the quality of the products available (1).

**Question Answer Marks Guidance** 

 3(c) Analyse how information on changes in a firm’s revenue can be obtained from price elasticity of demand calculations. 

 PED definition or formula (1) PED provides information on how consumers react to a change in price (1). If PED is elastic / PED > 1, a fall in price will raise revenue (1) as quantity demanded will increase more (1) than proportionately/percentage (1). A rise in price will decrease revenue (1) as quantity demanded will decrease more than proportionately (1). If PED is inelastic / PED < 1, a rise in price will raise revenue (1) as quantity demanded will decrease less (1) than proportionately / percentage (1). A fall in price will decrease revenue (1) as quantity demanded will increase less than proportionately (1). If PED is perfectly elastic, a rise in price will cause revenue to fall to 0 (1) as consumers will stop buying completely (1) If PED is perfectly inelastic / PED = 0, a rise in price will raise revenue (1) as consumers will continue to buy the same amount (1) If PED has unit elasticity / PED = 1, a change in price will keep revenue unchanged (1) as quantity demanded will change by the same proportion (1).

Subsidies will enable producers to increase investment (1) increasing future output (1) Producers can maintain a stable livelihood (1) ensure a stable income (1) ensure jobs can continue to be provided (1). Subsidies can encourage new entrants to an industry (1) increasing competition (1) 

 Up to 5 marks on how subsidies are not beneficial: Subsidies may be relatively small (1) and not be enough to offset the firm’s losses (1) or not enough to offset higher costs (1). Subsidies can lead to complacency (1) where producers do not use subsidies in an effective way (1) they will be reluctant to lose the subsidies (1) and producers not receiving the subsidy e.g. those in a competing industry will be at a disadvantage (1). Subsidies have opportunity cost for the government (1). Other government provisions might be sacrificed (1) e.g. healthcare and education (1).
