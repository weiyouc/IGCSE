MARK SCHEME 

Maximum Mark: 90 

 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. 

Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2018 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components.

 Generic Marking Principles 

These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. 

## GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: 

 Marks must be awarded in line with: 

- the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question 

- the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question 

- the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. 

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: 

 Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). 

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: 

 Marks must be awarded positively : 

- marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the     scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate 

- marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do 

- marks are not deducted for errors 

- marks are not deducted for omissions 

- answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the     question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. 

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: 

 Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. 


## PUBLISHED 

## GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: 

Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). 

GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: 

Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

**Question Answer Marks Guidance** 

 1(a) Identify, from the extract, two goals of business organisations. 

 Survival / growth / profit maximisation / diversification 

## 2 

 1(b) Explain, using information from the extract, two reasons why the price of rubber fell between 2011 and 2016. 

 Supply exceeding demand / diagram showing excess supply (1) the existence of unsold rubber will encourage rubber producers to lower price (1). Improved production methods (1) lowering costs of production / increasing supply (1). The imposition of import restrictions / diagram showing the effect of import reductions (1) lowering demand for rubber / rubber producers may reduce prices to ensure their rubber is still competitive (1). Government subsidies (1) lowering costs of production / increasing supply / diagram showing supply increasing (1). 

## 4 

 1(c) Analyse how an increase in wages could cause inflation. 

 Higher wages may increase consumer expenditure (1) increasing total (aggregate) demand / diagram showing total (aggregate) demand increasing (1) causing demand-pull inflation (1) if demand rises by more than money supply / the economy is at, or near, full capacity (1). Higher wages may increase costs of production (1) decrease total (aggregate) supply / diagram showing total (aggregate) supply decreasing (1) causes costpush inflation (1) if wages rise by more than productivity / may cause a wageprice spiral (1).

 1(d) Analyse to what extent the information in Table 1 suggests that healthcare expenditure per head is an important influence on the infant mortality rate. 

 Generally, yes, it would be expected that countries spending a higher amount would have a lower infant mortality rate (1) because e.g. they would be able to afford more midwives/doctors (1). Examples of supporting evidence e.g. Liberia spends the least and has the highest (1) UK spends the most and has the lowest (1). There is an exception, Cuba (1) spends the 4th lowest and has the 2nd lowest infant mortality rate (1).

**Question Answer Marks Guidance** 

 1(e) Discuss whether or not having more of its workers employed in the tertiary sector would benefit the Liberian economy. 

 Up to 3 marks for why it might: Jobs in the tertiary sector tend to be better paid (1) may raise living standards (1) working conditions tend to be better (1) e.g. less dangerous (1) demand for services tend to increase more than demand for primary products (1) imports of services may be reduced (1) exports of services may increase (1) current account position may be improved (1). Productivity/skills may be higher in the tertiary sector (1) which may cause economic growth (1) may make the country more developed (1). A larger healthcare sector could reduce the infant mortality rate / increase life expectancy (1). May attract MNCs/FDI (1) increasing employment (1). 

 Up to 3 marks for why it might not: The country may be better at producing primary or manufactured products (1) the country has a climate suited to agriculture (1) which may reduce economic growth (1). There may be an opportunity cost in terms of less resources being available in the primary and secondary sectors (1). Some jobs in the tertiary sector are low-paid (1) example (1) because they require fewer skills (1). Many tertiary industries are based in cities (1) this may lead to problems of rural-urban migration / overcrowding (1). Liberia’s resources are more suited to producing rubber (1) which can be exported and bring in foreign exchange (1). Imports of manufactured/primary products may increase (1). 

 5 For all ‘Discuss’ questions 

 Each point may be credited only once, on either side of an argument, but separate development as to how/why the outcome may differ is to be rewarded. 

 Generic example Mark 

 Economic growth will increase 1 

 because of reason« e.g. demand for services is increasing globally 

## 1 

 Economic growth will decrease (reverse of 1st argument) 

## 0 

 because of a different reason / not a reverse argument e.g. a country’s resources may be more suited to producing primary products. 

## 1 

 Reward but do not expect reference to comparative advantage as equivalent to better at producing.

 1(f) Explain, using information from the extract, how the concept of opportunity cost affects all rubber farmers in Liberia. 

 Opportunity cost is the (next) best alternative foregone (1). The US MNC could use its resources to produce rubber (1) or cocoa/coffee (1). The local farmers could sell rubber (1) or rubber wood / make furniture (1). The farmers could use the money to buy more land (1) example, e.g. diversify into other areas / education for their children (1). Subsidies to farmers (1) could be used to help them in other ways e.g. education (1).

 4(d) Discuss whether or not people in developed countries are likely to save more than people in developing countries. 

 Up to 5 marks for why they might: On average people in developed countries have a higher income (1) so are more able to save (1) or more able to save larger amounts so may gain a higher interest rate (1). There tends to be a greater range of financial institutions in developed countries (1) more secure financial institutions (1) this gives greater confidence in saving (1). People in some developed countries may have a culture of saving (1) e.g. Japan (1). Inflation rate may be lower in developed countries (1) enabling people to save more of their income (1). 

 Up to 5 marks for why they might not: The lack of a developed welfare system in some developing countries (1) means that some people may save more for e.g. their old age / retirement (1) future health problems (1).

## 4 

 5(c) Analyse how an increase in the price elasticity of demand and the price elasticity of supply of its products could benefit a firm. 

 A more elastic demand would mean that the firm could reduce price (1) to raise revenue (1) as demand would rise by more than the fall in price (1) if revenue rises by more than costs, profit will increase (1). A more elastic supply will mean that the firm can adjust more quickly the amount it sells when price changes (1) the firm will be able to take greater advantage of an increase in demand / rise in price (1) the firm will be able to take more of its products off the market should price fall (1).
