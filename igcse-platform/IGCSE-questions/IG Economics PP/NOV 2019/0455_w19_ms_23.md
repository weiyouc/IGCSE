 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. 

Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2019 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components.

 Generic Marking Principles 

 These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside thespecific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with thesemarking principles.GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1:Marks must be awarded in line with:^ ^ 

 the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question ^ 

 the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question ^ 

 the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2:Marks awarded are always 

 whole marks 

 (not half marks, or other fractions). 

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3:Marks must be awarded 

 positively 

## : 

## ^ 

 marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond thescope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate ^ 

 marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do ^ 

 marks are not deducted for errors ^ 

 marks are not deducted for omissions ^ 

 answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by thequestion as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4:Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic leveldescriptors.

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5:Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range maybe limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6:Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds orgrade descriptors in mind.

 Guidance 

 1(e) 

 Analyse, using Fig.1.1, the relationship between copper output and revenue fromthe sale of copper.Expected relationship 

- a direct relationship would have been expected / moved in 

 same direction / as copper output rose, revenue should have risen (1). Evidence 

 in support of 

 unexpected 

 relationship 

## ^ 

 Does not support expected relationship / shows an inverse relationship (1). ^ 

 Between 2010–14 revenue rose (from 100 to 128) but output fell (from 100 to 90)so prices rose (1). ^ 

 Between 2014–17 revenue fell (from128 to 90) but output rose (from 90 to 108)which meant that prices fell (1). ^ 

 In 2014 copper revenue was highest 128 and output at its lowest 90, while in 2017copper revenue was at its lowest 90 and output at its highest 108, so changes inrevenue were greater than changes in output of copper (1). Analysis of inverse relationship 

## : 

## ^ 

 When output fell, price per unit may have risen more than fall in output, due to lossof economies of scale causing average costs to rise (1). ^ 

 Price for Zambian copper affected by world market prices (1). ^ 

 Copper is likely to be inelastic in demand so prices rise by more than fall in outputincreasing revenue (1).

 2(d) 

 Discuss whether or not a country with high wage rates will have a highunemployment rate.Up to 5 marks for why it might: ^ 

 High wages may mean high cost of production (1) this may mean higher prices /inflation (1) international competitiveness may be low (1) exports may fall (1)imports may rise (1) net exports may fall (1) total (aggregate) demand may fall (1)causing cyclical unemployment / firms may lay off workers (1). ^ 

 May encourage capital intensive production (1) particular industries may be drivenout of business by foreign competition (1) causing structural unemployment (1). Up to 5 marks for why it might not: ^ 

 High wages may motivate workers to work harder (1) making them feel appreciated(1) causing productivity to be high (1) resulting in high demand for labour (1). ^ 

 Workers may be working with high value capital equipment (1) keeping cost per unitlow (1). ^ 

 High wages can mean high consumer spending (1) so total (aggregate) demandmay be high (1) resulting in higher demand for workers (1). ^ 

 Wages may rise above benefits (1) leading to less voluntary unemployment (1). ^ 

 Higher tax revenue (1) allows government to increase spending on reducingunemployment e.g. training (1).
