 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2019 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components.

 Generic Marking Principles 

 These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside thespecific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with thesemarking principles.GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1:Marks must be awarded in line with:^  

 the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question ^ 

 the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question ^ 

 the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2:Marks awarded are always 

 whole marks 

 (not half marks, or other fractions). 

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3:Marks must be awarded 

 positively 

## : 

## ^ 

 marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyondthe scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate ^ 

 marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do ^ 

 marks are not deducted for errors ^ 

 marks are not deducted for omissions ^ 

 answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by thequestion as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4:Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic leveldescriptors.

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5:Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range maybe limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6:Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds orgrade descriptors in mind.

 1(e) 

 Analyse, using Table 1.1, the relationship between educationalspending and the unemployment rate.Expected relationship 

- a country that spends more (a high proportion) 

 of their GDP on education would have a low unemployment rate / acountry with a higher unemployment rate is likely to spend less oneducation / it is an inverse relationship (1). Reasons 

 for expected relationship – workers would be likely to be more 

 skilled and productive / higher unemployment may result in less taxrevenue to spend on education (1). Evidence in support 

 of expected relationship – e.g. New Zealand or US 

 (1) highest spenders and lowest unemployment rates (1). Evidence against 

 expected relationship – e.g. Argentina or South Africa 

 (1) Argentina spends a lower proportion than Ghana and Brazil but has alower unemployment rate / South Africa spends more a higher proportionthan Argentina and Brazil but has a higher unemployment rate (1).
