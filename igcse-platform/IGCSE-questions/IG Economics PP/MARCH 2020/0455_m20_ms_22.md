**ECONOMICS 0455/22** Paper 2 Structured Questions **March 2020** MARK SCHEME Maximum Mark: 90 

 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. 

Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the March 2020 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components.

 Generic Marking Principles 

 These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside thespecific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with thesemarking principles.GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1:Marks must be awarded in line with:^ •^ 

 the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question 

-^ 

 the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question 

-^ 

 the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2:Marks awarded are always 

 whole marks 

 (not half marks, or other fractions). 

 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3:Marks must be awarded 

 positively 

 : 

-^ 

 marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of thesyllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate 

-^ 

 marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do 

-^ 

 marks are not deducted for errors 

-^ 

 marks are not deducted for omissions 

-^ 

 answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question asindicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4:Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors.GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5:Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limitedaccording to the quality of the candidate responses seen).GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6:Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors inmind.

 Discuss whether or not skilled workers are always paid more thanunskilled workers. In assessing each answer, use the table opposite.Why they might be: •^ 

 skilled workers may be in shorter supply as they may require trainingand qualifications

 skilled workers may be in inelastic supply and demand for them may beinelastic

 skilled workers may have stronger bargaining power

 Skilled workers may be more mobile. Why they might not be: •^ 

 skilled workers may have less experience and may be in less promotedpositions

 skilled workers may place more importance on non-wage factors whendeciding what jobs to do 

-^ 

 skilled workers in poorer countries may have lower wages than someunskilled workers in richer countries. Example of a L 

 evel 3 

 answer: 

 Skilled workers may be paid more than unskilled workers as they have morequalifications and/or experience, so demand may be high compared tosupply. Supply could be low due to long training required to learn skills, sothe labour market would be more competitive and skilled workers higherpaid. Demand for the products skilled workers provide may be higher, sotheir pay could be higher due to higher derived demand. Also, they maybelong to stronger trade unions which have more bargaining power tonegotiate for higher pay.

 Answer

 Guidance 

 2(d) 

 It is also possible that unskilled workers could be higher paid. This isbecause their work may be dangerous, e.g. miners, so the supply of workerswilling to do the job may be lower and firms have to pay more to attractworkers. Long working hours (less leisure time) and poor working conditionsmean unskilled workers may be higher paid, and if the work is boring andvery few people are willing to do the job. For example, cleaners in the USare paid much higher wages than cleaners in India as the number of peoplewilling to accept a job as a cleaner in the US is very low. There is even apossibility that unskilled workers could be paid higher than skilled workers. Principal Examiner comment:This is a strong L3 response. It is a two-sided answer with depth and logicallinks. For example, the candidate links qualifications and experience todemand for and supply of workers, as well as linking demand for workerswith demand for the products they produce. The candidate discusses someof the key influences on wage determination.

 Discuss whether or not demand for coffee is likely to rise in the future. In assessing each answer, use the table opposite.Why it might: •^

 price may fall (due to e.g. subsidies) increasing people’s willingnessand ability to buy coffee 

-^

 population may increase. Why it might not: •^ 

 price of substitutes, such as tea / coffee produced by other countries,may fall so people may switch away from drinking coffee

-^ 

 taxes / tariffs may be imposed on coffee 

-^ 

 Less may be spent on marketing. Example of a 

 Level 2 

 answer: 

 Coffee is an inelastic good which means the demand for it remains thesame irrespective of the price. The demand for coffee increases with time asthe population grows, so demand may be a constant growth. However,demand may not rise in the future as there are alternatives to coffee.Education on the harmful effects of coffee has increased leading to lessconsumption of coffee, reducing the demand for it.

 Principal Examiner comment:The answer is two-sided but lacks depth. It starts with a confused statementon the meaning of a product having price-inelastic demand. It then correctlyidentifies an influence on demand for coffee (population) and showsunderstanding of how an increase in population will affect demand forcoffee. On side two, the influence of alternatives (substitutes) is accurateand there is a clear link between education and reduced demand for coffee.More discussion on, for example, changes in relative price or quality ofsubstitutes would have been appropriate.

 Discuss whether or not a cut in the rate of interest will increaseinvestment. In assessing each answer, use the table opposite.Why it might: •^ 

 it may increase consumer spending as there will be less reward fromsaving, which may encourage firms to increase their output

 it will reduce the cost of borrowing to purchase capital goods

 MNCs may be attracted into the country as investment will be cheaper. Why it might not: •^ 

 the rate of interest may still be high / may be expected to rise in thefuture

 firms may be pessimistic about the future

 the cost of capital equipment may rise 

-^ 

 lower saving may reduce funds available for investment

 banks may be reluctant to lend. Example of a 

 Level 2 

 answer: 

 A cut in the rate of interest will decrease the cost of taking out loans. Thiswill enable firms to borrow more and lead to them buying more capital goodswhich will increase investment. The return on saving would also reduce,encouraging firms to spend their money rather than save it as theopportunity cost of spending would be lower. Lower interest rates might alsomean that consumer spending is greater so firms’ profits may increaseenabling them to expand.
