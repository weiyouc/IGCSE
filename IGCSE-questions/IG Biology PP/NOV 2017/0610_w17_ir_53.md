## READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST 

These Confidential Instructions give details of the apparatus required by each candidate for each experiment in this paper. A summary of the questions that will be presented to the candidates is included, where appropriate, to allow the biology teacher to test the apparatus appropriately. **Testing must be done out of sight of all candidates.** 

**No access to the question paper is permitted in advance of the examination**. 

Centres are reminded that candidates are expected to follow the instructions on the question paper and record all their results. They will not be penalised if these results are not what they expect. 

The Supervisor should make sure the Supervisor’s Report is fully completed and a copy is enclosed with each packet of scripts. 

It is assumed that the ordinary apparatus of a science laboratory will be available, including a supply of purified water (distilled or deionised). 

If arrangements are made for different sessions for different groups of candidates, care must be taken to ensure that the different groups of candidates are effectively isolated so that **no information passes between them**. 

**All specimens should carry only the code letters and numbers as indicated and their identity should not be revealed to the candidates.** 

Supervisors should ensure that all specimens have the correct identity attached to the specimen and that these are **not** removed during the examination. 

If a candidate breaks any of the apparatus, or loses any of the material supplied, the matter should be rectified and a note made in the Supervisor’s Report. 

Supervisors are advised to remind candidates that all substances in the examination should be treated with caution. Pipette fillers and eye protection should be used where necessary. 

In accordance with COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) Regulations, operative in the UK, a hazard appraisal of the examination has been carried out. 

The following codes are used where relevant: 

**C** corrosive **MH** moderate hazard 

**HH** health hazard **T** acutely toxic 

**F** flammable **O** oxidising 

**N** hazardous to the aquatic environment 

Centres are reminded that they are **not** permitted to open the question paper envelopes before the examination. 

If there are any difficulties with any aspect of setting up this practical examination that the Centre is not able to resolve, it is essential for Centres to contact Cambridge as soon as possible by **email** to info@ cie.org.uk, by **fax** to +44 1223 553558 or by **phone** to +44 1223 553554.

Each candidate should be provided with: 

 (i) a 1 cm thick slice of orange which has been cut from the fruit transversely to show the segments. It should be presented on a white tile labelled orange slice for question 1(f). 

 stalk 

 slice orange transversely 

 (ii) three different Citrus spp. fruits e.g. orange, lemon, lime, grapefruit. These should be cut into quarters. Each student should be provided with enough pieces of fruit to obtain at least 5 cm^3 of juice from each type of fruit when it is squeezed. Students will raise their hand to request more fruit if 5 cm^3 of juice is not obtained from the initial supply of fruit provided. Quarters should be presented in dishes labelled with the common name of each fruit. 

 (iii) three containers to collect the juice e.g. beakers or plastic cups 

 (iv) one glass marker pen 

 (v) three large test-tubes 

 (vi) one 25 cm^3 measuring cylinder 

 (vii) four 2 cm^3 syringes without needles 

 (viii) one 250 cm^3 glass beaker labelled water-bath 

 (ix) a supply of hot water at 90 °C. Candidates will raise their hand when they are ready for hot water to half-fill their water-bath. 

 (x) 10 cm^3 of Benedict’s solution (as normally used for food testing) provided in a 100cm 3 glass beaker and labelled reducing sugar test solution 

 (xi) view of a timer or clock to measure minutes accurately 

 (xii) paper towels 

 (xiii) a container labelled washing water half-filled with tap water 

 (xiv) an empty container labelled waste water

 (xv) suitable eye protection 

 The Supervisor ( not the Invigilator) is expected to carry out the practical aspects of Question 1 and record their results in the space provided in the Supervisor’s Report. This must be done during the examination, using the same apparatus and reagents as the candidates but out of sight of the candidates.
