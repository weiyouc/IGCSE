**1** You are going to investigate the rate of photosynthesis in leaf tissue using leaf discs that have been cut from fresh whole leaves. When photosynthesis takes place in a leaf oxygen gas is produced and this is released into the air spaces in the leaf. carbon dioxide + water glucose + oxygen Removing the air from the air spaces allows the leaf discs to sink when they are placed in water. As photosynthesis takes place the leaf discs start to float. The time taken for the leaf discs to start to float indicates the rate of photosynthesis. **Read all the instructions but DO NOT CARRY THEM OUT until you have drawn a table for your results in the space provided in 1(a)(i).** You should use the gloves and eye protection provided while you carry out the practical work. Step 1 Label three test-tubes **W1** , **W2** and **W3**. Label the remaining three test-tubes **S1** , **S2** and **S3**. Put all six test-tubes back into the test-tube rack. Step 2 Remove the plunger from a 10 cm^3 syringe and use forceps to carefully place all 10 leaf discs into the empty syringe barrel. Step 3 Cover the nozzle of the syringe with your finger and pour approximately 5 cm^3 of distilled water into the barrel of the syringe as shown in Fig. 1.1a. Step 4 Insert the plunger back into the syringe and hold it upright as shown in Fig. 1.1b. Remove your finger from the nozzle and slowly push the plunger into the barrel to remove all of the air. Do not remove any of the distilled water and take care not to crush the leaf discs.

 Step 5 Hold the syringe barrel in one hand and place your finger over the nozzle of the syringe. Use your other hand to pull on the plunger for five seconds as shown in Fig. 1.1c, taking care not to pull the plunger out of the syringe barrel. After five seconds let go of the plunger. The leaf discs should sink to the bottom of the syringe barrel as shown in Fig. 1.1d.

Continue with step 7 if, after three further attempts, the leaf discs have still not sunk. Step 7 Remove the plunger and pour the contents of the syringe barrel back into the Petri dish base. Step 8 Use forceps to carefully place one of the leaf discs that sank into each of the six test-tubes you labelled in step 1.

 Step 11 Place a lamp at a distance of 10 cm from the test-tube rack containing the six test-tubes you have prepared, as shown in Fig. 1.3. W1 W2 W3 S1 S2 S3 

 10 cm^ lamp Fig. 1.3 Step 12 Switch on the lamp and time how long it takes for each of the discs to start to rise. You should time all six test-tubes at the same time and record your results in your table in 1(a)(i). If a leaf disc has not started to rise after five minutes, stop timing and record the result as >300 in your table. (a) (i) Prepare a table to record your results.

 (b) A student used the leaf disc method to investigate photosynthesis in plants grown in different conditions. The student selected two plants, X and Y which were of the same species but were grown in different locations. A leaf was taken from each plant and leaf discs were cut out of the leaf from plant X and the leaf from plant Y. The results of their investigation are shown in Table 1.1. Table 1.1

**2 (a)** Fig. 2.1 and Fig. 2.2 are photomicrographs of cross-sections of leaves taken from different areas of the same tree. Some parts of the tree are shaded from the Sun and some are in direct sunlight. The cross-section shown in Fig. 2.1 was taken from a leaf grown in the shade and the cross-section shown in Fig. 2.2 was taken from a leaf grown in direct sunlight.
