## READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST 

These Confidential Instructions give details of the apparatus required by each candidate for each experiment in this paper. A summary of the questions that will be presented to the candidates is included, where appropriate, to allow the biology teacher to test the apparatus appropriately. **Testing must be done out of sight of all candidates.** 

**No access to the question paper is permitted in advance of the examination.** 

Centres are reminded that candidates are expected to follow the instructions on the question paper and record all their results. They will not be penalised if these results are not what they expect. 

The Supervisor should make sure the Supervisor’s Report is fully completed and a copy is enclosed with each packet of scripts. 

It is assumed that the ordinary apparatus of a science laboratory will be available, including a supply of purified water (distilled or deionised). 

If arrangements are made for different sessions for different groups of candidates, care must be taken to ensure that the different groups of candidates are effectively isolated so that **no information passes between them**. 

**All specimens should carry only the code letters and numbers as indicated and their identity should not be revealed to the candidates.** 

Supervisors should ensure that all specimens have the correct identity attached to the specimen and that these are **not** removed during the examination. 

If a candidate breaks any of the apparatus, or loses any of the material supplied, the matter should be rectified and a note made in the Supervisor’s Report. 

Supervisors are advised to remind candidates that **all** substances in the examination should be treated with caution. Pipette fillers and eye protection should be used where necessary. 

In accordance with COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) Regulations, operative in the UK, a hazard appraisal of the examination has been carried out. 

The following codes are used where relevant: 

**C** corrosive **MH** moderate hazard 

**HH** health hazard **T** acutely toxic 

**F** flammable **O** oxidising 

**N** hazardous to the aquatic environment 

Centres are reminded that they are **not** permitted to open the question paper envelopes before the examination. 

If there are any difficulties with any aspect of setting up this practical examination that the Centre is not able to resolve, it is essential for Centres to contact Cambridge as soon as possible by **email** to info@cie.org.uk, by **fax** to +44 1223 553558 or by **phone** to +44 1223 553554.

**Question 1** 

Each candidate should be provided with: 

 (i) seven empty test-tubes (125 mm × 15 mm) 

 (ii) means to mark glassware, for example a marker pen 

 (iii) 20 cm^3 of 1% albumin solution in a beaker labelled 1% protein solution 

 (iv) 50 cm^3 distilled water in beaker labelled distilled water 

 (v) 25 cm^3 biuret reagent normally used for food testing in a beaker labelled biuret reagent 

 (vi) 5 cm^3 0.15% albumin solution in a test-tube labelled A 

 (vii) 5 cm^3 0.60% albumin solution in a test-tube labelled B 

 (viii) test-tube rack or other means of support for nine test-tubes 

 (ix) two 1 cm^3 syringes (without needles) 

 (x) three 5 cm^3 syringes (without needles) 

**(xi)** (^) tap water in a beaker labelled **water for washing (xii)** empty beaker labelled **waste (xiii)** white tile or white card **(xiv)** timer, or sight of a clock with a second hand **(xv)** paper towels **(xvi)** eye protection **(xvii)** disposable gloves **Question 2 (i)** ruler with a mm scale. **Preparation of solutions HH** powdered albumin may be an irritant to the eye. Solutions with a concentration of 1% or less are not hazardous. _1% albumin solution_ Weigh 10 g powdered albumin and add to 250 cm^3 of warm distilled water (at a maximum temperature of 25 °C). Stir slowly until the albumin dissolves. It can take several minutes for the albumin to dissolve completely. Make up to 1 dm^3 with distilled water. The solution can be made 48 hours before the examination and stored in a refrigerator.

_0.60% albumin solution_ 

Weigh 1.5 g of solid albumin and add it to 100 cm^3 of warm distilled water (at a maximum temperature of 25 °C). Stir slowly until the albumin dissolves and then make up to 250 cm^3 with distilled water. The solution can be made 48 hours before the examination and stored in a refrigerator. This is sufficient for 50 candidates. 

Alternatively, dilute 1% albumin solution in a ratio of 3 parts albumin solution to 2 parts distilled water. 

_0.15% albumin solution_ 

Put 37.5 cm^3 of 1% albumin solution into a clean beaker and make up to 250 cm^3 with distilled water. The solution can be made 48 hours before the examination and stored in a refrigerator. This is sufficient for 50 candidates. 

_Biuret reagent_ 

This can be purchased from a commercial supplier. The reagent should be fresh and stored in a cool dark place. 

 The Supervisor ( not the Invigilator) should carry out the practical aspects of Question 1 and record their results in the space provided in the Supervisor’s Report. This must be done during the examination, using the same apparatus and reagents as the candidates but out of sight of the candidates.
