MARK SCHEME 

Maximum Mark: 40 

 Published 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. 

Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2017 series for most Cambridge IGCSE®, Cambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and some Cambridge O Level components.

 1(a)(i) one table drawn with appropriate lines and number of cells ; 

 correct column and row headings with appropriate units ; 

 ten correct values recorded in correct boxes ; 

 correct conversion of minutes to seconds for all numbers ; 

## 4 

 R if units are in the body of table 

 1(a)(ii) X = 71 s ; Y = 229 s ; 

 2 A correct times in minutes and seconds 

 ecf from 1(a)(i) for wrong conversion of minutes to seconds 

 max 1 if not rounded up to nearest whole number max 1 if both correct whole numbers but no units 

 1(a)(iii) labelled axes with units ; 

 even scale and at least 50% of grid used for time axis ; 

 two correctly plotted bars (±½ a small square), of equal width and separated by a space ; 

## 3 

 ecf from 1(a)(ii) 

 1(a)(iv) gas / oxygen (produced) is trapped within the leaf space ; density is reduced / becomes lighter / buoyancy increases ; 

## 1 

 1(a)(v) to identify anomalies / for reliability / for repeatability / to calculate an average ; 

## 1 

 1(a)(vi) measured: time taken for leaf disc to rise / rate of photosynthesis ;

 1(a)(vii) size of leaf disc / AW ; 

 concentration of sodium hydrogencarbonate (solution) / 2% ; 

 volume / height of, sodium hydrogencarbonate / solution ; 

 plant species ; 

 light intensity / distance of the lamp ; 

 2 I temperature / pH 

 1(b) 

 error ;; improvement ;; 

 measuring height / not measuring volume / imprecise volume of sodium hydrogencarbonate 

 use same volume (in test-tubes of the same diameter) / measure volume / use a burette / measuring cylinder / graduated pipette 

 leaf discs different distances from lamp / different light intensities / position of lamp 

 arrange equidistant / do each testtube separately / AW 

 determining when leaf disc starts to rise is subjective 

 time until leaf disc reaches, the surface / or rises to a particular level 

 timing multiple leaf discs stagger timing 

 heating of test-tubes by lamp heat-shield / LED lamps / waterbath / AW 

## 4 

 each improvement must relate to the given error 

 A test-tube rack blocks light / AW
