 Paper 5 Practical Test February/March 2016 CONFIDENTIAL INSTRUCTIONS 

 Great care should be taken to ensure that any confidential information given does not reach the candidates either directly or indirectly. 

 If you have any problems or queries regarding these Confidential Instructions, please contact CIE by email info@cie.org.uk by phone +44 1223 553554 by fax +44 1223 553558 stating the Centre number, the nature of the query and the syllabus number quoted above.

## READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST 

These instructions give details of the apparatus required by each candidate for each experiment in this paper. A summary of the questions that will be presented to the candidates is included, where appropriate, to allow the biology teacher to test the apparatus appropriately. **Testing must be done out of sight of all candidates.** 

**No access to the question paper is permitted in advance of the examination.** 

Centres are reminded that candidates are expected to follow the instructions on the question paper and record all their results. They will not be penalised if these results are not what they expect. 

The Supervisor should make sure the Supervisor’s Report is fully completed and a copy is enclosed with each packet of scripts. 

It is assumed that the ordinary apparatus of a science laboratory will be available, including a supply of purified water (distilled or deionised). 

If arrangements are made for different sessions for different groups of candidates, care must be taken to ensure that the different groups of candidates are effectively isolated so that **no information passes between them**. 

**All specimens should carry only the code letters and numbers as indicated and their identity should not be revealed to the candidates.** 

Supervisors should ensure that all specimens have the correct identity attached to the specimen and that these are **not** removed during the examination. 

If a candidate breaks any of the apparatus, or loses any of the material supplied, the matter should be rectified and a note made in the Supervisor’s Report. 

Supervisors are advised to remind candidates that **all** substances in the examination should be treated with caution. Pipette fillers and eye protection should be used where necessary. 

In accordance with COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) Regulations, operative in the UK, a hazard appraisal of the examination has been carried out. 

The following codes are used where relevant: 

**C** = corrosive **MH** = moderate hazard 

**HH** = health hazard **T** = acutely toxic 

**F** = flammable **O** = oxidising 

**N** = hazardous to the aquatic environment 

Centres are reminded that they are **not** permitted to open the question paper envelopes before the examination. 

If there are any difficulties with any aspect of setting up this practical examination that the Centre is not able to resolve, it is essential for Centres to contact the Product Manager as soon as possible by **e-mail** to info@cie.org.uk, by **fax** to +44 1223 553558 or by **phone** to +44 1223 553554.

 Question 1 

 Each candidate should be provided with: 

 (i) two test-tubes 

 (ii) test-tube rack 

 (iii) a marker pen to mark the glassware and spotting tile 

 (iv) view of a clock or timer that allows the candidate to time minutes accurately 

 (v) approximately 150 cm^3 warm water (40 °C), in a 250 cm^3 beaker, labelled warm water 

 (vi) approximately 150 cm^3 iced water, in a 250 cm^3 beaker, labelled cold water 

 (vii) means of measuring 3 cm^3 , e.g. 5 cm^3 syringe (without needle) 

 (viii) three dropping pipettes 

 (ix) white spotting tile (with at least 12 depressions/wells) 

 (x) iodine in potassium iodide solution (as normally used for food testing), presented in a dropping bottle, labelled iodine solution 

 (xi) 10 cm^3 1% starch solution, in a small beaker, labelled starch solution 

 (xii) 5 cm^3 1% amylase solution, in a small beaker, labelled amylase 

 (xiii) eye protection 

 (xiv) protective gloves 

 (xv) access to paper towels (in case of spillages) 

 (xvi) glass rod for stirring 

 Preparation of solutions and trialling 

 1% amylase solution 

 This is prepared by dissolving 1 g of amylase (or 1 cm^3 of stock amylase solution) in 90 cm^3 of distilled (or deionised) water and making up to 100 cm^3. This will provide sufficient solution for 20 candidates. 

 The activity of amylase from different sources, and of different ages, may vary. 1 cm^3 of the 1% amylase solution should break down all of the starch in 3 cm^3 of the 1% starch solution at 40 °C within 4 minutes. It is important that this is trialled before the examination. If the time taken is greater, the concentration of the amylase solution should be increased accordingly. 

 1% starch solution 

 This is prepared by heating 1 g of soluble starch in 90 cm^3 of distilled (or deionised) water until the liquid clears. Allow to cool and make up to 100 cm^3. This will provide sufficient solution for 10 candidates.

**Question 2** 

No additional materials are required. 

 The Supervisor ( not the Invigilator) should carry out the practical aspects of Question 1 and record their results in the space provided in the Supervisor’s Report. This must be done during the examination, using the same apparatus and reagents as the candidates but out of sight of the candidates.
