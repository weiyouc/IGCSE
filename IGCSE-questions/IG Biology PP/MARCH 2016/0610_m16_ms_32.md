## MARK SCHEME for the March 2016 series 

# 0610 BIOLOGY 

## 0610/32 Paper 3 Theory (Core), maximum raw mark 80 

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements of the examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. 

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. 

Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. 

Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the March 2016 series for most Cambridge IGCSE® and Cambridge International A and AS Level components.

- A accept (for answers correctly cued by the question, or guidance for examiners) 

- AW alternative wording (where responses vary more than usual) 

- AVP any valid point 

- ecf credit a correct statement / calculation that follows a previous wrong response 

- ora or reverse argument 

- ( ) the word / phrase in brackets is not required, but sets the context 

- underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted) 

- max indicates the maximum number of marks that can be given
