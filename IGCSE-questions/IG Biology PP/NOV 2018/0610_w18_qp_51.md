**1** Grapes are soft fruits that contain sugars. You are going to investigate the concentration of reducing sugars in grapes. **Read all the instructions but DO NOT CARRY THEM OUT until you have drawn a table for your results in the space provided in 1(a)(iii).** You should use the safety equipment provided while you are carrying out the practical work. Step 1 Put 50 cm^3 of distilled water into a measuring cylinder. Step 2 Place four of the grapes into the measuring cylinder and record the total volume of distilled water and grapes in the measuring cylinder in Table 1.1. **(a) (i)** Calculate the total volume of the four grapes and record it in Table 1.1. **Table 1.1** total volume of distilled water and grapes in the measuring cylinder / cm^3 

 total volume of the grapes / cm^3 

 [1] (ii) Calculate the average volume of one grape using your answer to 1(a)(i). Space for working. 

 ................................................... cm^3 [1] Step 3 Label a test-tube G. Step 4 Pour the contents of the measuring cylinder into the container labelled waste. Remove the four grapes and dry them with a paper towel. Return the four grapes to the Petri dish base. Step 5 Use a spatula to crush all of the grapes in the Petri dish base and try to extract as much juice as possible. Pour the grape juice into the small beaker labelled grape juice. Step 6 Use a clean syringe to put 5.0 cm^3 of the grape juice into test-tube G. Step 7 Label three test-tubes, S1 , S2 and S3. Step 8 Add 5.0 cm^3 of the solution labelled S to the test-tube labelled S1. Step 9 Add 1.0 cm^3 of the solution labelled S to the test-tube labelled S2 and then add 4.0 cm^3 of distilled water. Mix the contents of S2. Step 10 Add 0.2 cm^3 of the solution labelled S to the test-tube labelled S3 and then add 4.8 cm^3 of distilled water. Mix the contents of S3.

 Step 11 Use a clean syringe to add 5.0 cm^3 of Benedict’s solution to each of test-tubes S1 , S2 , S3 and G. Raise your hand when you are ready for hot water to be added to the beaker labelled water-bath. Step 12 Place the test-tubes S1, S2, S3 and G into the water-bath at the same time. Start timing and record the time at which a colour change first appears in each test-tube. Record your results in your table in 1(a)(iii). (iii) Prepare a table to record your results. Your table should include: 

- the solutions tested 

- the time, in seconds, of the **first** appearance of a colour change in each solution. Record your results in your table as you carry out the practical work.

 (b) (i) The concentration of reducing sugar in solution S and S1 is 200 g per dm^3. The concentration of reducing sugar in solution S3 is 8 g per dm^3. Calculate the concentration of reducing sugar in solution S2 , using the information in step 9.

 (d) Grapes develop in large groups attached to their parent plant. As they develop, grapes increase in size and ripen. Fig. 1.1 shows one group of grapes. 

 Fig. 1.1 A student suggested that the concentration of reducing sugars in grapes changed as the grapes developed and ripened. Describe how the method you used in steps 3 to 12 could be modified to determine if there is a change in the concentration of reducing sugars in grapes during development. ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ..............................................................................................................................................

 (b) Some students measured the average increase in chest circumference, during breathing, when at rest. Each student wrapped a tape measure around their chest just below the armpits, as shown in Fig. 2.2. 

 Fig. 2.2 Each student then breathed out and took a measurement of their chest circumference. They then breathed in and took a second measurement. The difference between the two measurements is the increase in chest circumference. Table 2.1 shows the results of their measurements.
