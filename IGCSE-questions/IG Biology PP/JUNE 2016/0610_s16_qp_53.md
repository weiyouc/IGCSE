**Read through all of the questions in this paper carefully before starting work. 1** Fig. 1.1 shows an elephant, _Loxodonta africana_. They have large ears which help them to control their body temperature. 

 Fig. 1.1 When the elephant is too hot, more blood is pumped into the blood vessels in the elephant’s ears. Increasing blood flow to the surface of the skin helps the elephant to cool down. You are going to set up a model of what happens in the elephant’s ears as shown in Fig. 1.2.

 Fig. 1.2 You will place hot water into two small beakers and stand each one in a larger beaker. One of the small beakers will have ‘ears’ and the other will not. The ‘ears’ will be represented by two plastic dropping pipettes. You will squeeze and release the pipette ears throughout the experiment so that water continuously moves out of and into the pipettes. You will measure and record the starting temperature of the hot water in both small beakers and then record the temperature of the water every minute for a total of eight minutes.

 (a) Before you start the practical work, prepare a table to record your observations in the space below.

 Step 1 Place one small beaker into each of the large beakers. Step 2 Cut two circles from the piece of cardboard. The circles should fit inside the large beakers and completely cover the top of the small beakers. Step 3 Make a small hole in each circle of cardboard for a thermometer to pass through and make two additional holes in one of the circles of cardboard for the pipette ears to pass through. Step 4 Carefully insert the thermometers and pipette ears through the holes in the circles of cardboard as shown in Fig. 1.2. Step 5 Raise your hand for hot water. The hot water will be poured into both of the small beakers. Step 6 Immediately and carefully place the circles of cardboard on top of the small beakers. Measure and record the starting temperature of the water in both beakers. Step 7 Start the timer. Step 8 Begin to squeeze and release the pipette ears so that they empty and fill with hot water. Continue doing this throughout the experiment. Step 9 Measure the temperature of the water in each small beaker every minute for a total of eight minutes. Step 10 Record your observations in the table in part (a).

 (c) (i) A student repeated this experiment and calculated the change in temperature of the water each minute for eight minutes in both small beakers. The change in temperature in the small beaker with pipette ears was 18 °C. The change in temperature in the small beaker without pipette ears was 11 °C. Explain why it is important to calculate the change in temperature in each beaker. ........................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................... .......................................................................................................................................[2] (ii) Use the information in part (c)(i) to calculate the rate of temperature change in the small beaker with pipette ears for the student’s experiment.

**2** A student placed the cut end of a celery stick into a coloured dye as shown in Fig. 2.1. 

 Fig. 2.1 The student left the celery stick in the dye for five minutes and then removed it. The student cut a 0.5 cm slice from the end of the celery stick that had been in the dye. The cut surface of the celery stick is shown in Fig. 2.2.

 (b) The size of the piece of celery in Fig. 2.2 is shown by the line AB. Measure the length of AB on Fig. 2.2. length of AB on Fig. 2.2 ........................................ mm Mark on your drawing a line in the same position as the line AB on Fig. 2.2. Measure this line. length of line on drawing ........................................ mm magnification = length of line on drawinglength of AB Calculate the magnification of your drawing using the information above and your answers. Show your working. Give your answer to the nearest whole number. 

 magnification ....................................................... [3] (c) It is possible to measure how far the dye has travelled up the celery stick. This is done by cutting 0.5 cm pieces from the end of the celery stick (that has been in the dye) and counting how many pieces are cut before the dye is no longer visible. (i) A student cut seven 0.5 cm pieces from the end of a celery stick before the dye was no longer visible. Calculate how far up the celery stick the dye had travelled. Write your answer in millimetres.
