**1** Fig. 1.1 shows an elephant, _Loxodonta africana_. They have large ears which help them to control their body temperature. 

 Fig. 1.1 When the elephant is too hot, more blood is pumped into the blood vessels in the elephant’s ears. Increasing blood flow to the surface of the skin helps the elephant to cool down. A student set up a model of what happens in the elephant’s ears, as shown in Fig. 1.2.

 They placed hot water into two small beakers and stood each one in a larger beaker. One of the small beakers had ‘ears’ and the other did not. The ‘ears’ were represented by two plastic dropping pipettes. The student squeezed and released the pipette ears throughout the experiment so that water continuously moved out of and into the pipettes. The student placed a cardboard lid on top of each small beaker. They made holes in the cardboard lids so that a thermometer and the pipettes could pass through them. (a) The student recorded the starting temperature of the water in both small beakers. The thermometer readings are shown in Fig. 1.3.

 (b) The student measured and recorded the temperature of the hot water in both beakers every minute for a total of eight minutes. The student obtained the results shown in Fig. 1.4. 

 With ears (pipettes) the temperature went down to 84 after a minute, then 80, 78, 76, 74, 72, 71 and finished at 70°C after 8 minutes. Without the ears the other beaker of water dropped every minute to 83, 82, 81, 79, 78, 77, 76 and finished at 75. 

 Fig. 1.4 Prepare a table to record the observations shown in Fig. 1.4 and the starting temperatures from Fig. 1.3. Complete the table by entering all of the results.

 (c) Suggest one safety precaution that should be taken during this experiment. ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ...............................................................................................................................................[1] (d) (i) A student repeated this experiment and calculated the change in temperature of the water each minute for eight minutes in both small beakers. The change in temperature in the small beaker with pipette ears was 18 °C. The change in temperature in the small beaker without pipette ears was 11 °C. Explain why it is important to calculate the change in temperature in each beaker. ........................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................... .......................................................................................................................................[2] (ii) Use the information in part (d)(i) to calculate the rate of temperature change in the small beaker with pipette ears for the student’s experiment. Show your working. Give your answer to two significant figures.

**2** A student placed the cut end of a celery stick into a coloured dye as shown in Fig. 2.1. 

 Fig. 2.1 The student left the celery stick in the dye for five minutes and then removed it. The student cut a 0.5 cm slice from the end of the celery stick that had been in the dye. The cut surface of the celery stick is shown in Fig. 2.2.

 (b) The size of the piece of celery in Fig. 2.2 is shown by the line AB. Measure the length of AB on Fig. 2.2. length of AB on Fig. 2.2 …………………………… mm Mark on your drawing a line in the same position as the line AB on Fig 2.2. Measure this line. length of line on drawing………………………………………..mm magnification = length of line on drawinglength of AB Calculate the magnification of your drawing using the information above and your answers. Show your working. Give your answer to the nearest whole number. 

 magnification ............................................................... [3] (c) It is possible to measure how far the dye has travelled up the celery stick. This is done by cutting 0.5 cm pieces from the end of the celery stick (that has been in the dye) and counting how many pieces are cut before the dye is no longer visible. (i) A student cut seven 0.5 cm pieces from the end of a celery stick before the dye was no longer visible. Calculate how far up the celery stick the dye had travelled. Write your answer in millimetres.
