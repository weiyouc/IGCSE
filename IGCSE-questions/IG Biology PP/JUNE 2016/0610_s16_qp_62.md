**1** Some students test the composition of three liquid food supplements. **(a) (i)** State the chemical test the students would use to show that protein is present in a liquid sample of a food supplement. .......................................................................................................................................[1] The students carried out this test for protein on liquid samples of food supplements **P** , **Q** and **R**. Food supplements **P** and **R** contained protein. **(ii)** Complete Table 1.1 to show the results from the students’ tests for protein. **Table 1.1** food supplement colour at start colour at end **P Q R** [2] The students carried out a test for vitamin C on liquid samples of food supplements **P** , **Q** and **R**. When iodine solution is mixed with starch, a blue-black colour is observed. Vitamin C stops this blue-black colour from forming. Step 1 The students labelled a test-tube **P** and added 3 cm^3 of food supplement **P** to the testtube. Step 2 They added 1 cm^3 of starch solution to test-tube **P**. Step 3 The students added iodine solution to the test-tube, one drop at a time. They counted the drops as they added them. They shook the test-tube gently after adding each drop and stopped adding drops when a blue-black colour remained. A blue-black colour remained in **P** after **12** drops of iodine solution had been added. Step 4 They repeated steps **1** to **3** with food supplements **Q** and **R**. A blue-black colour remained in **Q** after **1** drop of iodine solution had been added. A blue-black colour remained in **R** after **5** drops of iodine solution had been added.

 Table 1.2 shows how the number of drops of iodine solution added relates to the vitamin C content of the food supplement. Table 1.2 number of drops of iodine solution added vitamin C content 1 none 2–3 low 4 or more high (b) Use the results of the students’ experiments and the information in Table 1.2 to complete Table 1.3. Table 1.3 food supplement number of drops of iodine solution added vitamin C content P Q R [2] The students carried out a test for reducing sugar on liquid samples of food supplements P , Q and R. (c) (i) Name the solution used for the reducing sugar test. .......................................................................................................................................[1] (ii) Give one safety precaution that should be used when carrying out this test. .......................................................................................................................................[1] A positive result for the test for reducing sugar is the appearance of a brick-red colour. The quicker the brick-red colour appears, the higher the concentration of reducing sugar. Step 5 The students labelled a test-tube P2 and added a sample of food supplement P to the test-tube. Step 6 They added 2 cm^3 of the test solution to test-tube P2. Step 7 The students repeated steps 5 and 6 with food supplements Q and R. Step 8 They placed test-tubes P2 , Q2 and R2 into hot water, and started a timer. Step 9 The students observed the test-tubes carefully and noted the time when the brick-red colour appeared in each test-tube. If there was no colour change after 180 seconds (3 minutes), the students recorded ‘more than 180’ as the result for that test-tube.

 A brick-red colour appeared in test-tube R2 after 25 seconds and in test-tube P2 after 1 minute and 15 seconds. No brick-red colour appeared in test-tube Q2. (d) Complete Table 1.4 to show the students’ results for the reducing sugar test. Table 1.4 test-tube time for brick-red colour to appear / s
