**Read through all the questions on this paper carefully before starting work. 1** Metabolic reactions in cells produce toxic chemicals which can be converted to harmless or less toxic chemicals. Hydrogen peroxide is broken down using the enzyme catalase which is found in most cells. Fig. 1.1 shows this reaction. catalase hydrogen peroxide water and oxygen 2H 2 O 2 2H 2 O + O 2 **Fig. 1.1** You are going to investigate the effect of alcohol (ethanol) on the activity of catalase found in potato. **Read all the instructions but DO NOT CARRY THEM OUT until you have drawn a table for your results in the space provided in question 1 (a)(ii).** You should use the safety equipment provided while you are carrying out the practical work. The potato pieces in dishes **A** and **B** have both been cut to the same size. **(a) (i)** Measure the length, width and height of one of the pieces of potato.

 [1] Step 1 Label four test-tubes, A1 , A2 , B1 and B2. Add 10 cm^3 of hydrogen peroxide solution to each of the test-tubes. Step 2 Cut two 30 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm slices from the potato piece in dish A. Leave the slices in dish A with the remaining portion of the potato piece. When cutting, use a white tile and cut away from your hand. Step 3 Cut two 30 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm slices from the potato piece in dish B. Leave the slices in dish B with the remaining portion of the potato piece. When cutting, use a white tile and cut away from your hand.

 Step 4 Place the free end of the delivery tube into the large test-tube of water. Step 5 Use forceps to remove one of the 30 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm slices of potato from dish A and put the slice into the hydrogen peroxide solution in test-tube A1. Step 6 Immediately place the rubber bung containing the delivery tube into test-tube A1 , as shown in Fig. 1.3. Make sure it fits tightly. Start the timer. delivery tube

Step 8 Repeat steps 4 to 7 for the second 30 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm slice of potato from dish A and use test-tube A2. Step 9 Repeat steps 4 to 8 for the 30 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm slices of potato from dish B and use test-tubes B1 and B2. (ii) Prepare a table to record your results. Your table should show: 

- the numbers of bubbles produced by each slice of potato in 3 minutes 

- the mean number of bubbles produced by the potato piece from each of dishes **A**     and **B**. Record your results in your table as you carry out the practical work.

**(f)** In an investigation into the effects of alcohol on the nervous system, people were asked to carry out a test on their reaction time. The person being tested looked at a coloured block on a computer screen. As soon as the colour changed they pressed a button. The time taken to press the button was recorded by the computer. This was their reaction time. Twenty people were tested before and after consuming a drink containing the same concentration of alcohol. Table 1.2 shows the results of this investigation. **Table 1.2** test person
