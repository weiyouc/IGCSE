**1** The leaves of plants contain green chlorophyll and other coloured pigments that are used in photosynthesis to trap light. 

 You are going to investigate the pigments present in a green leaf using chromatography. The process of chromatography separates the pigments. The more soluble the pigment the further it moves. 

 In this experiment the pigments in green leaves dissolve in a solvent ( S1 ). The solvent moves up the paper carrying the pigments different distances. 

 You should use the safety equipment provided while you are carrying out the practical work. 

 Step 1 Use a ruler to draw a pencil line across the strip of chromatography paper 3 cm from one end. 

 Step 2 Place a leaf on top of the pencil line and transfer the pigment from the leaf onto the pencil line by rolling a metal disc over the leaf as shown in Fig. 1.1. You should see a faint green line on the chromatography paper.

 Step 3 Move the leaf so that a different part of the leaf is over the line you have just made and repeat rolling the metal disc across the leaf along the pencil line. Repeat this step until you have a dark green line. 

 Step 4 Pour solvent S1 into a test-tube to a depth of 2 cm. Put the lid back on the solvent container to prevent evaporation. 

 Step 5 Carefully lower the strip of chromatography paper into the test-tube with the green line at the bottom. Do not allow the green line to go below the level of solvent S1 as shown in Fig. 1.2.

 Step 6 Fold the free end of the chromatography paper over the edge of the outside of the testtube and place a stopper in the test-tube. 

 Do not move the test-tube during steps 7 and 8. 

 Step 7 Start the stop-clock and observe the movement of solvent S1 up the chromatography paper for one minute while it is inside the test-tube. 

 Step 8 Wait for five more minutes and then observe the movement of the solvent again while it is inside the test-tube. If the solvent is near the top of the chromatography paper move on to step 9. If it is not near the top of the chromatography paper wait for another five minutes and then move on to step 9. 

 Step 9 When the solvent is near the top of the chromatography paper (or you have waited for a total of 11 minutes) remove the stopper from the test-tube and lift out the strip of chromatography paper. Put the stopper back into the test-tube to prevent the solvent from evaporating. 

 Step 10 Place the chromatography paper on a paper towel and use the pencil to draw a line across the paper to mark how far up the chromatography paper solvent S1 has reached. Leave the paper to dry for one minute.

 (b) Some students used a different method to obtain the pigments from a leaf by cutting up the leaf and grinding it with ethanol. They filtered the mixture and obtained a chlorophyll extract which was then evaporated until only a small volume of extract remained. Ethanol is flammable. 

 (i) State one safety precaution that the students would take when evaporating substances containing ethanol.

 (ii) A chromatography paper was prepared in the same way as in step 1. A small drop of the concentrated chlorophyll extract was placed on the pencil line and allowed to dry. The chromatography paper was then placed in a test-tube containing a different solvent ( S2 ) and left for 10 minutes. 

 Fig. 1.4 shows the appearance of the chromatogram after it was removed from solvent S2 and allowed to dry.

 The different pigments can be compared by calculating their Rf value. 

 Rf value = 

 the maximum distance moved by the pigment from the start line the maximum distance moved by the solvent from the start line 

 Fig. 1.4 shows where these distances were measured on the chromatogram for the green pigment. 

 The students calculated some of the Rf values. The results are shown in Fig. 1.5.

 Calculate the Rf values for the orange-yellow pigment in Fig. 1.4. 

 Give your answer to two decimal places.

 (f) Some plants have leaves that are not green. For example the plant may have red, purple or yellow leaves. 

 A student predicted that leaves of different colours would have different rates of photosynthesis. 

 Plan an investigation to find out if the student’s prediction is correct.

 (i) Scientists count the number of red blood cells to estimate the total number of red blood cells in the blood. 

 Cells that are touching the top and left side of the grid are counted. 

 Cells touching the bottom and right side of the grid are not counted. 

 State how many red blood cells would not be counted in the sample in Fig. 2.1.

 (ii) The actual size of the counting grid in Fig. 2.1 is 0.20 mm × 0.20 mm. The depth of the counting grid is 0.10 mm. 

 Calculate the volume of the counting grid.

 (iii) A different sample of blood was also diluted 200 times. 

 The number of red blood cells inside the same size counting grid was 95. 

 Calculate the number of red blood cells per mm 3 of undiluted blood. 

 Use the formula: 

 number of red blood cells per mm 3 = 

 red blood cells counted × dilution volume of the counting grid Space for working.

 The haemoglobin content of their blood was measured and the percentage of people with anaemia was calculated.
