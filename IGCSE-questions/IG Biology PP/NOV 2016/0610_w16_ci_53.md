 Paper 5 Practical Test October/November 2016 CONFIDENTIAL INSTRUCTIONS Great care should be taken to ensure that any confidential information given does not reach the candidates either directly or indirectly.

## READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST 

These Instructions give details of the apparatus required by each candidate for each experiment in this paper. A summary of the questions that will be presented to the candidates is included, where appropriate, to allow the biology teacher to test the apparatus appropriately. **Testing must be done out of sight of all candidates.** 

**No access to the question paper is permitted in advance of the examination**. 

Centres are reminded that candidates are expected to follow the instructions on the question paper and record all their results. They will not be penalised if these results are not what they expect. 

The Supervisor should make sure that the Supervisor’s Report is fully completed and a copy is enclosed with each packet of scripts. 

It is assumed that the ordinary apparatus of a science laboratory will be available, including a supply of purified water (distilled or deionised). 

If arrangements are made for different sessions for different groups of candidates, care must be taken to ensure that the different groups of candidates are effectively isolated so that **no information passes between them**. 

**All specimens should carry only the code letters and numbers as indicated and their identity should not be revealed to the candidates.** 

Supervisors should ensure that all specimens have the correct identity attached to the specimen and that these are **not** removed during the examination. 

If a candidate breaks any of the apparatus, or loses any of the material supplied, the matter should be rectified and a note made in the Supervisor’s Report. 

Supervisors are advised to remind candidates that all substances in the examination should be treated with caution. Pipette fillers and eye protection should be used where necessary. 

In accordance with COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) Regulations, operative in the UK, a hazard appraisal of the examination has been carried out. 

The following codes are used where relevant: 

**C** corrosive **MH** moderate hazard **HH** health hazard **T** acutely toxic **F** flammable **O** oxidising **N** hazardous to the aquatic environment 

Centres are reminded that they are **not** permitted to open the question paper envelopes before the examination. 

If there are any difficulties with any aspect of setting up this practical examination that the Centre is not able to resolve, it is essential for Centres to contact the Product Manager as soon as possible by **email** to info@cie.org.uk, by **fax** to +44 1223 553558 or by **phone** to +44 1223 553554.

 Question 1 

 Each candidate should be provided with: 

 (i) a rack to hold a large test-tube 

 (ii) a white tile 

 (iii) a scalpel 

 (iv) a 30 cm ruler 

 (v) six potato cylinders, at least 5 cm long, in a Petri dish labelled potato sticks 

 (vi) a large test-tube with a delivery tube and bung (The delivery tube should be flexible with an internal diameter of 3 mm. It must be long enough to reach from the large test-tube to the measuring cylinder in the plastic tub.) 

 (vii) a 1.5 dm^3 plastic tub, two-thirds filled with tap water (The tub must be long enough and deep enough to submerge and fill a 25 cm 3 measuring cylinder.) 

 (viii) view of a clock or timer that allows the candidate to time minute intervals accurately 

 (ix) one 25 cm 3 measuring cylinder and one 10 cm 3 measuring cylinder 

 (x) a 10 cm 3 plastic syringe (without needle) 

 (xi) 100 cm 3 of 3% hydrogen peroxide, in a beaker labelled hydrogen peroxide 

 (xii) a 250 cm 3 beaker labelled waste for the student to place used hydrogen peroxide and potato cylinders into for disposal 

 (xiii) a 250 cm^3 beaker containing distilled water labelled water for washing 

 (xiv) eye protection and plastic gloves 

 Solution preparation 

 3% hydrogen peroxide 

 Dilute a stock solution of hydrogen peroxide (20 vol or 6%) by adding 500 cm 3 of distilled water to 500 cm 3 of 6% hydrogen peroxide (to make 1 dm 3 ). This will be sufficient for 10 candidates. 

 The hydrogen peroxide (6%) stock solution should be newly bought and stored in a cool dark place. 

 The diluted solution can be made the day before the examination and stored in a sealed container in a cool dark place. It should be allowed to reach room temperature before the examination. 

 Preparation of potato 

 It is recommended that potato cylinders are cut from Irish potato ( Solanum tuberosum ), using a 5–7 mm cork borer. You are advised to have spare potato cylinders in case students require them. 

 Trialling the experiment 

 Prior to the examination, the Supervisor should check that adding two whole potato sticks to the diluted solution will produce a 3–10 cm 3 volume of oxygen gas in a three-minute time period.

**Question 2** 

Each candidate should be provided with: 

 (i) one ruler (with mm scale) 

 The Supervisor ( not the Invigilator) should carry out the practical aspects of Question 1 and record their results in the space provided in the Supervisor’s Report. This must be done during the examination, using the same apparatus and reagents as the candidates but out of sight of the candidates.
