# CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL EXAMINATIONS Cambridge International General Certificate of Secondary Education MARK SCHEME for the May/June 2015 series 0610 BIOLOGY 

## This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements ofthe examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does notindicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal ExaminerReport for Teachers.Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.^ 0610/62^ Paper 6 (Alternative to Practical), maximum raw mark 40

 both headings correct: leaf size^ /^ piece

 (iii)^ larger (leaf size) is faster^ /^ smaller (leaf size) is slower 

### ;^ [1] 

 (b)^ oxygen is produced^ ;^ reference to action of catalase 

 ; bubbles of (oxygen / gas / air) collect on the leaf and cause itto rise / AW ; (oxygen / gas) is less dense so leaf rises^ ;^

 Mark^ Guidance (c)^ either: quicker as there is more cut edge 

 /^ more damaged cells^ ; (so) has more catalase exposed to peroxide 

### ; 

 (so) produces more oxygen^ ; or: slower because leaf piece is heavier 

### /^ AW^ ; 

 not enough gas^ /^ oxygen to lift extra mass

 /^ concentration of hydrogenperoxide solution ; type of leaf / species of leaf^ /^ same leaf^ ; same distance moved by leaf^ /^ tubes marked at same heightor at 40 mm ; mass / size of metal wire ;

 Mark^ Guidance (ii)^ timing three tubes at same time 

 ; measure each separately ; cutting the leaves accurately ; use a cutter of known size / cork borer of known diameter^ /^ cutaround a template ; using different parts / thickness / age of the leaf^ ; cut leaves from same part / same thickness^ /^ same age^ ; measuring volume of peroxide with a drawn line^ /^ AW^ ; (instead) measure out exact volume usingsyringe / burette / pipette / measuring cylinder^ /^ AW^ ; metal wire may damage leaf / may react with hydrogenperoxide ; use wire that does not cause damage^ /^ is unreactive^ ; using the same hydrogen peroxide for both leaves^ /^ AW^ ; use fresh peroxide so concentration is the same^ ;^

 (iv)^ hazard:^ hydrogen peroxide is irritant 

 /^ harmful^ /^ AW^ ; safety precaution:^ wear eye protection

 sequence is Z > X > Y > W^ ; ora comparative use of data^ ; conclusion: different species have different amounts 

 /^ activity of catalase^ /^ enzyme^ ; leaf Z has more^ /^ more active, catalase than any of theother leaves / AW^ ; ora leaf Z (hairy so) traps more bubbles

 leaf W has thicker veins^ /^ more vascular tissue, so heavier
