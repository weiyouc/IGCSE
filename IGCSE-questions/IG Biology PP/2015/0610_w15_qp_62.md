**1** During respiration, a chemical is produced that causes the indicator methylene blue to change from blue to colourless. Some students investigated the effect of temperature on the rate of respiration in yeast, using yeast and methylene blue. 

**-** A ruler was used to measure 2 cm from the top of **three** test-tubes and a line was drawn on     each test-tube. 

**-** Yeast suspension with glucose was poured into each test-tube until it reached the line drawn     on the test-tube. 

**-** Three beakers were labelled: **cold** , **warm** and **hot**. 

**-** One test-tube was placed in each container. 

**-** A mixture of ice and water was placed into the beaker labelled **cold** , tap water at room     temperature into the beaker labelled **warm** and hot water from a tap into the beaker labelled     **hot**. 

**-** A thermometer was used to measure the temperature in each beaker. 

**-** The test-tubes were left for five minutes and then 1 cm 3 of methylene blue was added to each     test-tube. 

**-** A glass rod was used to stir the mixture so the methylene blue spread evenly. 

**-** A stopper (bung) was placed in each test-tube and a timer started. 

**-** The time for the methylene blue to become colourless was recorded. This was trial 1. 

**-** The same procedure for trial 1 was repeated twice to give results for trial 2 and trial 3.     Fig. 1.1 shows the temperatures of the water in each beaker and the times, in minutes and     seconds, for each test-tube to become colourless.

- record the temperatures in degrees Celsius 

- record the times in **seconds**.

 (c) Some students placed samples of each type of pollen grain on a microscope slide and added a drop of dilute sugar solution. Pollen tubes started to grow. To find out which of the pollen tubes grew faster, students measured the length of the pollen tubes every 2 minutes for 20 minutes.

 (d) The plant that produces pollen grain R produces fruits that contain seeds. These fruits disperse the seeds by splitting along the edges, throwing out the seeds. The students counted the number of seeds in a random sample of 100 fruits. Fig. 2.2 is a frequency histogram of their results. 50
