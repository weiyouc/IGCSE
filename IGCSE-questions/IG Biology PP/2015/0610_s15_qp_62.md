**1** Hydrogen peroxide is produced by metabolism in most cells and is toxic in high concentration. Cells contain the enzyme catalase to break down the hydrogen peroxide. Fig. 1.1 shows this reaction. hydrogen peroxide catalase water + oxygen **Fig. 1.1** Some students investigated the activity of catalase found in leaves. Two different sized pieces of leaf were placed into hydrogen peroxide solution and the time taken for the pieces of leaf to rise was recorded. 

**-** A ruler was used to measure a distance of 40 mm from the bottom of **three** containers and a     line drawn on the containers. 

**-** Hydrogen peroxide solution was poured into each container until it reached the line at 40 mm. 

**-** A ruler and scissors were used to cut **three** pieces of leaf, each measuring 10 mm × 10 mm,     from leaves of the same species. 

**-** A 1 cm length of metal wire was bent into a U-shape. A piece of leaf was placed into the     U-shape and the wire pinched to hold the leaf in place as shown in Fig. 1.2.        leaf           metal wire 

 Fig. 1.2 

**-** One piece of leaf was placed in the hydrogen peroxide solution in each of the containers and     pushed gently with forceps to make it sink. 

**-** The leaves were observed and a timer was used to measure the time taken for each piece of     leaf to rise from the bottom of the container to the surface of the hydrogen peroxide solution. 

**-** Forceps were used to remove the pieces of leaf from each container. 

**-** The experiment was then repeated using three pieces of leaf cut to a size of 15 mm × 15 mm     from leaves of the same species as previously used.
