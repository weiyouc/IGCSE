**1** In this experiment, you will investigate moments using a balancing method. Carry out the following instructions, referring to Fig. 1.1. metre rule 

(^0100) bench pivot P (^) _a_ Q _w b_ **Fig. 1.1 (a)** Place the metre rule on the pivot, without the loads P and Q, and adjust its position so that the metre rule is as near as possible to being balanced. **The rule must remain at this position on the pivot throughout the experiment**. Place the load P on the metre rule so that the **edge** that is furthest from the pivot is exactly at the 10.0 cm mark on the rule. Record in Table 1.1, the distance _a_ between this **edge** of the load P and the pivot, as shown in Fig. 1.1. Place the load Q on the metre rule and adjust the position of load Q so that the metre rule is as near as possible to being balanced. Determine the distance _b_ between the **centre** of load Q and the pivot, as shown in Fig. 1.1. Record the distance _b_ in Table 1.1. Repeat the procedure, with the **edge** of the load P that is furthest from the pivot at the 15.0 cm, 20.0 cm, 25.0 cm and 30.0 cm marks. Record all the readings in Table 1.1. **Table 1.1** _a_ / cm _b_ / cm

**2** In this experiment, you will investigate the rate of cooling of water under different conditions. A greater rate of cooling occurs if there is a greater change in the temperature during the same period of time. Carry out the following instructions referring to Fig. 2.1 and Fig. 2.2. Beaker A has a lid. Beaker B is on a mat made of the same material as the lid. The mat and the lid have the same thickness.

Place the lid on the beaker and place the thermometer in the beaker, as shown in Fig. 2.1. Record in Table 2.1 the temperature θ of the hot water at time t = 0. Immediately start the stopclock. After 30 s, measure the temperature θ shown on the thermometer. Record the time t = 30 s and the temperature reading in Table 2.1. Continue recording the time and temperature readings every 30 s until you have six sets of readings in Table 2.1. [3]

 (c) Pour 200 cm^3 of hot water into beaker B. Check that the beaker is on the mat and place the thermometer in the beaker, as shown in Fig. 2.2. Do not use the lid. Record in Table 2.2 the temperature θ of the hot water at time t = 0. Immediately start the stopclock. After 30 s, measure the temperature θ shown on the thermometer. Record the time t = 30 s and the temperature reading in Table 2.2. Continue recording the time and temperature readings every 30 s until you have six sets of readings in Table 2.2. [2]

 (d) Look carefully at the readings in Table 2.1 and in Table 2.2. (i) Tick the box to show your conclusion from the readings. The lid reduces the rate of cooling of the water significantly more than the mat reduces the rate of cooling of the water. The mat reduces the rate of cooling of the water significantly more than the lid reduces the rate of cooling of the water. There is no significant difference between the lid and the mat in reducing the rate of cooling of the water.

**4** A student is investigating the relationship between the thickness of a converging (convex) lensand its focal length. Fig. 4.1 shows the cross-section of a converging lens. 

 The focal length f of a lens can be calculated if u (the distance between the object and the lens) and v (the distance between the lens and the image on a screen) are known. 

The equation is: _f_ = (^) ( _uuv_ + _v_ ) _t_ **Fig. 4.1** Plan an experiment to investigate the relationship between the thicknessconverging lenses. You may add to Fig. 4.1 as part of your answer. You are _t_ and the focal length **not** required to carry _f_ of out this experiment. The following apparatus is available to the student: illuminated object selection of lenses of different thicknesses and a lens holder screen metre rule 30 cm ruler two rectangular wooden blocks with the longest sides longer than the diameter of the lenses. In your plan, you should: 

# • draw a diagram to show the arrangement of the apparatus, labelling u and v 

# • explain briefly how you would carry out the investigation, including the measurements you 

 would take 

# • explain briefly how you would determine the thicknessif it helps your explanation) t of each lens (you may draw a diagram 

# • draw a suitable table, with column headings, to show how you would display your readings 

 (you do not need to use the equation to calculate focal length).
