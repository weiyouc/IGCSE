# • Place the transparent block, largest face down, on the ray-trace sheet supplied. The block 

 should be approximately in the middle of the paper. Draw the outline of the block ABCD. 

# • Remove the block and draw a normal NL at the centre of side AB. Label the point E where 

 the normal crosses AB. Label the point M where the normal crosses CD.

 as shown in Fig. 3.1. 

# • Place two pins P 1 and P 2 on the line FE , placing one pin close to E. Label the positions 

 of P 1 and P 2. 

# • Replace the block and observe the images of P 1 and P 2 through side CD of the block 

 so that the images of P 1 and P 2 appear one behind the other. Place two pins P 3 and 

P 4 between your eye and the block so that P 3 and P 4 , and the images of P 1 and P (^2) seen through the block, appear one behind the other. Label the positions of P 3 and P 4. Remove the block. [2] 

# (b) • Draw a line joining the positions of P 3 and P 4. Continue the line until it meets the normal 

 NL. Label the point K where this line crosses CD.

**4** A student is investigating the effect of draughts (moving air) on the rate of cooling of hot water. The following apparatus is available: electric fan with four speed settings supply of hot water thermometer 250 cm 3 beaker 250 cm 3 measuring cylinder stopwatch clamp, boss and stand. Plan an experiment to investigate the effect of draughts on the rate of cooling of hot water. You are **not** required to carry out this investigation. You should: 

# • explain briefly how you would carry out the investigation 

# • state the key variables that you would control 

# • draw a table, or tables, with column headings, to show how you would display your 

 readings (you are not required to enter any readings in the table) 

# • explain how you would use your readings to reach a conclusion. 

 You may draw a diagram if it helps your explanation.
