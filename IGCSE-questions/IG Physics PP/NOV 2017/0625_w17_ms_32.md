It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate thedetails of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would haveconsidered the acceptability of alternative answers.Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report forTeachers.Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. **Cambridge Assessment International Education**^ Cambridge International General Certificate of Secondary Education (^) **Published October/November 20170625/32** Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2017 series for mostCambridge IGCSEcomponents. ® (^) , Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level
