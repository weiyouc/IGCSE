**1** A student is determining the mass of a metre rule by a balancing method. He is using the apparatus shown in Fig. 1.1. metre rule mass^ _M_

 Fig. 1.1 (a) He places the metre rule on the pivot and then places a mass M = 20 g with its centre at the 95.0 cm mark. Suggest how he could ensure that the mass is placed accurately at the 95.0 cm mark. You may draw a diagram.

 (b) Keeping the mass at the 95.0 cm mark, he adjusts the position of the metre rule on the pivot until the metre rule is as near to being balanced as possible. The student then determines the distance a between the 50.0 cm mark and the pivot and the distance b between the 95.0 cm mark and the pivot. He repeats the procedure for values of M = 40 g, 60 g, 80 g and 100 g. His results are shown in Table 1.1. Table 1.1 M / g a / cm b / cm S 20 6.5 38.5 40 11.2 33.8 60 15.2 29.8 80 17.1 27.9 100 20.0 25.0 For each value of M , calculate and record in the table the value S , where S = ab. [1]

 (d) (i) Determine the gradient G of the graph. Show clearly on the graph how you obtained the necessary information.

 (ii) The mass M R of the metre rule is numerically equal to G^1. Write down a value for M R to a suitable number of significant figures for this experiment.

 (e) Determination of M R by this method relies on the centre of mass of the rule being at the 50.0 cm mark. Suggest how you could use the apparatus to test whether this is the case. You may draw a diagram.

 (a) The students pour hot water into each test-tube, up to the level of the top of the insulation. They record, in Table 2.1, the temperatures θ of the water in each test-tube and immediately start a stopclock. They also record the temperatures θ at times t = 30 s, 60 s, 90 s, 120 s,150 s and 180 s. Complete the table.

(ii) Draw an arrow on this voltmeter to show the reading when the crocodile clip is attached to a length l = 60 cm of the resistance wire. [2] (c) Calculate, and record in the table, the resistance R of the lamp for each value of l , using the equation R = V I. [2] (d) From the results and the observations of the lamp filament, state the link, if any, between the brightness of the lamp and its resistance. Explain clearly how the results support your statement. statement .................................................................................................................................. explanation ............................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................................................... ...................................................................................................................................................

 (e) A student wishes to see if another lamp shows the same link between brightness and resistance. However, his lamp only glows dimly when a potential difference of 3 V is applied across it. The student decides that a method using a resistance wire is not suitable. Suggest an alternative circuit and apparatus which would allow him to vary the brightness of his lamp and measure the potential difference and current for his lamp. You may draw a circuit diagram.

[1] **(b)** Using metal tongs, one of the students places the iron block in the hot water in beaker **A** for 30 seconds. He then removes the block and places it in the cold water in beaker **B**. The other student then measures the temperature of the water in beaker **B** and finds that it has risen to 35 °C. Their teacher suggests that this value is lower than expected.
