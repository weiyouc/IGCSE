**1** You are going to investigate how the temperature changes when aqueous sodium hydroxide reacts with solutions of two different acids, acid **R** and acid **S**. 

 Read all the instructions carefully before starting the experiments. 

 Instructions You are going to do two experiments. 

 (a) Experiment 1 

 ● Put the polystyrene cup into the 250 cm^3 beaker for support. ● Use the measuring cylinder to pour 50 cm^3 of aqueous sodium hydroxide into the polystyrene cup. ● Measure the temperature of the solution and record it in the table. ● Fill the burette up to the 0.0 cm^3 mark with acid R. ● Add 5.0 cm^3 of acid R to the aqueous sodium hydroxide in the polystyrene cup and stir the solution with the thermometer. ● Measure and record the highest temperature of the solution in the table. ● Add a further 5.0 cm^3 of acid R to the polystyrene cup and stir the solution with the thermometer. ● Measure and record the highest temperature of the solution in the table. ● Continue to add 5.0 cm^3 portions of acid R to the polystyrene cup until a total volume of 40.0 cm^3 of acid R has been added. Stir after each addition and measure and record the highest temperature of the solution in the table in each case. ● Pour the solution away and rinse the polystyrene cup.

 (c) Experiment 2 

 ● Empty the burette and rinse it with distilled water. Discard this liquid. ● Rinse the burette with some of acid S. Discard this acid. ● Repeat Experiment 1 but using acid S instead of acid R. ● Record your results in the table.
