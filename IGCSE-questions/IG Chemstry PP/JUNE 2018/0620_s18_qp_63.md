**1** Zinc sulfate crystals are hydrated. They contain water of crystallisation. A student did an experiment to find the mass of water in hydrated zinc sulfate crystals. The hydrated zinc sulfate crystals were weighed and then heated with a Bunsen burner to remove the water as shown.

**2** A student investigated how the temperature changed when aqueous sodium hydroxide reacted with solutions of two different acids, acid **R** and acid **S**. Two experiments were done. _Experiment 1_ ● A measuring cylinder was used to pour 50 cm^3 of aqueous sodium hydroxide into a polystyrene cup. The temperature of the solution was measured. ● A burette was filled up to the 0.0 cm^3 mark with acid **R**. ● 5.0 cm^3 of acid **R** was added to the aqueous sodium hydroxide in the polystyrene cup and the solution stirred. ● The highest temperature of the solution was measured. ● A further 5.0 cm^3 of acid **R** was added to the polystyrene cup and the solution was stirred. ● The highest temperature of the solution was measured. ● Further 5.0 cm^3 portions of acid **R** were added to the polystyrene cup until a total volume of 40.0 cm^3 of acid **R** had been added. The highest temperature of the solution was measured after each addition.
