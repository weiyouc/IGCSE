**2** A student investigated what happened when two different solids, **S** and **T** , dissolved in water. 

 Two experiments were carried out. Experiment 1 ● Using a measuring cylinder, 30 cm 3 of distilled water were poured into a polystyrene cup. The initial temperature of the water was measured. ● 2.0 g of solid S were added to the polystyrene cup and the solution was stirred with a thermometer. ● The maximum temperature of the solution was measured. ● The solution was poured away and the polystyrene cup was rinsed out with distilled water. ● The procedure was repeated using 3.0 g of solid S. ● The procedure was repeated using 5.0 g of solid S. (a) Use the thermometer diagrams to record the temperatures in the table.
