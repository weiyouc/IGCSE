 2 A student investigated what happened to the temperature when two different solids, W and X , dissolved in water. 

 Two experiments were carried out. 

 Experiment 1 

 ● Using a measuring cylinder, 30 cm 3 of distilled water were poured into a polystyrene cup. The initial temperature of the water was measured at time = 0 seconds. ● Solid W was added to the water, a timer was started and the solution was stirred with a thermometer. ● The temperature of the solution was measured every 10 seconds for 90 seconds. 

 (a) Use the thermometer diagrams to record the temperatures in the table.

 Experiment 2 

 ● The polystyrene cup was emptied and rinsed with water. ● Experiment 1 was repeated using solid X. ● The temperature of the solution was measured every 10 seconds for 90 seconds.

**3** Two solutions, **Y** and **Z** , were analysed. 

# Solution Y was aqueous chromium(III) nitrate. 

 Tests were carried out on both solutions. 

 tests on solution Y

**4** Washing soda crystals are crystals of hydrated sodium carbonate, Na 2 CO 3 .10H 2 O. When exposed to the air, some of the water is lost from the crystals and a new substance is formed. This process occurs faster in hotter climates. 

 Plan an experiment to determine the percentage of water by mass present in the new substance. 

 You are provided with common laboratory apparatus.
