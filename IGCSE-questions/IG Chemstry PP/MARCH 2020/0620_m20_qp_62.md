**2** A student investigated the time taken to collect 40 cm^3 of hydrogen gas when magnesium reacts with dilute sulfuric acid. 

 Five experiments were done using the apparatus shown. 

 water 

 inverted 50 cm^3 measuring cylinder 

 dilute sulfuric acid and distilled water 

 Experiment 1 ● Using a measuring cylinder, 8 cm^3 of dilute sulfuric acid was poured into the boiling tube. ● Using a second measuring cylinder, 12 cm 3 of distilled water was added to the acid in the boiling tube. ● The apparatus was set up as shown in the diagram, ensuring the inverted measuring cylinder was full of water. ● The bung was removed from the boiling tube. ● A coiled length of magnesium ribbon was added to the boiling tube, the bung was immediately replaced and a timer started. ● The time taken for 40 cm 3 of gas to be collected was measured. ● The student felt the outside of the boiling tube. 

 (a) (i) The student noticed that the boiling tube was warm. 

 What does this tell you about the type of reaction? 

 ....................................................................................................................................... [1] 

 (ii) Describe one change that could be made to the apparatus to help keep the temperature of the contents of the boiling tube constant during the reaction. 

 ....................................................................................................................................... [1] 

 Experiment 2 ● The boiling tube was rinsed out with distilled water. ● Experiment 1 was repeated using 10 cm^3 of dilute sulfuric acid and 10 cm 3 of distilled water. 

 Experiment 3 ● Experiment 2 was repeated using 12 cm^3 of dilute sulfuric acid and 8 cm 3 of distilled water. 

 Experiment 4 ● Experiment 2 was repeated using 16 cm^3 of dilute sulfuric acid and 4 cm 3 of distilled water. 

 Experiment 5 ● Experiment 2 was repeated using 20 cm^3 of dilute sulfuric acid and no distilled water.

 (d) (i) From your graph , deduce the time taken to collect 40 cm^3 of gas if the experiment was repeated using 9 cm 3 of dilute sulfuric acid. 

 Show clearly on the grid how you worked out your answer.

 (e) The rate of reaction can be calculated using the equation shown. 

 rate of reaction = 

 volume of gas collected time taken to collect the gas 

 (i) Use this equation to calculate the rate of reaction in Experiment 1. Give the units for the rate of reaction you have calculated. 

 rate of reaction = .............................. units = .............................. [2] 

 (ii) In which Experiment, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, was the rate of reaction greatest?

 .............................................................................................................................................. [1] 

 (g) The magnesium starts to react with the dilute sulfuric acid as soon as it is added. 

 (i) Why does this decrease the accuracy of the investigation?

 (ii) Describe one improvement that you could make to overcome this problem.

**3** Solution **J** and solid **K** were analysed. 

 tests on solution J 

 tests observations Solution J was colourless. Solution J was divided into three portions in three test-tubes. 

 test 1 

 Universal indicator paper was dipped into the first portion of solution J. 

 the universal indicator paper turned red 

 test 2 

 A spatula measure of sodium carbonate was added to the second portion of solution J. The gas given off was tested. 

 effervescence was seen, the gas produced turned limewater milky 

 test 3 

 1 cm^3 of dilute nitric acid and a few drops of aqueous silver nitrate were added to the third portion of solution J.
