 The syllabus is approved for use in England, Wales and Northern Ireland as a Cambridge International Level 1/Level 2 Certificate. 

 READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST 

 The teacher responsible for preparing the examination is not allowed to consult the Question Paper before the examination. Teachers should, as part of the preparation of the examination requirements, carry out any tests indicated on pages 2 and 3 in order to satisfy themselves that the supplied materials are satisfactory. 

 The Supervisor’s Report to be included with the scripts is given on pages 7 and 8. Please detach and enclose it with the scripts. If scripts are despatched in more than one envelope, it is essential that a copy of the Supervisor’s Results and of the Supervisor’s Report are sent inside each envelope. 

 More material may be issued if required, without penalty, but this should not be necessary. 

 Supervisors are advised to remind candidates that all substances in the examination should be treated with caution. Suitable eye protection should be provided. 

 In accordance with COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) Regulations, operative in the UK, a hazard appraisal of the examination has been carried out. 

 Attention is drawn, in particular, to certain materials used in the examination. The following codes are used where relevant. 

 C corrosive MH moderate hazard HH health hazard T acutely toxic F flammable O oxidising N hazardous to the aquatic environment 

 Hazard data sheets should be available from your suppliers. 

 If you have any queries regarding these Confidential Instructions, please contact Cambridge stating the Centre number, the nature of the query and the syllabus number quoted above.

**Question 1** 

Each candidate will require the following apparatus and chemicals. The labels of **solution B** and **solution C** must **not** include concentrations. 

 (a) 1 × 25 cm^3 measuring cylinder 

 (b) 1 × 50 cm^3 burette with stand and clamp 

 (c) 1 × 250 cm 3 conical flask 

# (d) 150 cm 3 of aqueous potassium manganate(VII), KMnO4 , of concentration 3.2 g / dm 3 labelled 

 solution A 

# (e) 50 cm^3 of aqueous ammonium iron(II) sulfate, (NH 4 ) 2 Fe(SO 4 )2 .6H 2 O, of concentration 20 g / dm 3 

 made by dissolving 20 g of the salt in 100 cm 3 of sulfuric acid of concentration 1 mol / dm 3 , and diluting to 1000 cm 3 , labelled solution B 

# (f) 50 cm^3 of aqueous ammonium iron(II) sulfate of concentration 60 g / dm 3 made by dissolving 

 60 g of the salt in 100 cm 3 of sulfuric acid of concentration 1 mol / dm 3 , and diluting to 1000 cm 3 , labelled solution C 

 (g) access to water and distilled water 

 (h) white tile 

 (i) funnel for filling burette 

# Note: Ammonium iron(II) sulfate is used because it is more stable than iron(II) sulfate. The Question 

# Paper will refer to solution B and solution C as iron(II) sulfate.
