**2** A student investigated the reaction between aqueous sodium thiosulfate and two different aqueous solutions of potassium iodate labelled solution **C** and solution **D**. 

 Two experiments were carried out. 

 Experiment 1 

 ● A burette was filled with aqueous sodium thiosulfate. The initial burette reading was recorded. ● Using a measuring cylinder, 20 cm^3 of solution C were poured into a conical flask. 10 cm^3 of dilute sulfuric acid and 1 g of potassium iodide were added to the flask to form a solution of iodine. The flask was swirled to mix the contents. 

 ● Aqueous sodium thiosulfate was slowly added from the burette to the flask and swirled to mix thoroughly. ● When the contents of the flask turned pale yellow, starch solution was added and the solution turned blue-black. ● More aqueous sodium thiosulfate was then added slowly to the flask until the solution just turned colourless. The final burette reading was recorded. 

 (a) Use the burette diagrams to record the readings in the table and complete the table.

 Experiment 2 

 ● The conical flask was emptied and rinsed with distilled water. ● Experiment 1 was repeated using solution D instead of solution C.

**3** Two solids, **E** and **F** , were analysed. Solid **F** was potassium iodide. Tests were carried out on each solid. Some of the observations on solid **E** are shown. 

 tests on solid E observations 

 Appearance of solid E. green solid 

 test 1 

 Solid E was heated gently then strongly. the solid turned black 

 test 2 

 Dilute sulfuric acid was added to solid E. 

 The gas given off was tested. 

 Excess aqueous ammonia was then added to the mixture in the test-tube. 

 rapid effervescence 

 limewater turned milky 

 a pale blue precipitate formed, which then dissolved to form a dark blue solution 

 test 3 

A flame test was carried out on solid **E**. (^) blue-green colour **(a) Test 1** states that the solid should be heated gently then strongly. In terms of safety, explain why it is necessary to heat gently at first. .................................................................................................................................................... ..............................................................................................................................................
