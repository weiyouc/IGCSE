**1** Hydrogen peroxide, H 2 O 2 (aq), decomposes slowly to form water and oxygen. 

 2H 2 O 2 (aq) 2H 2 O(l) + O 2 (g) 

# The addition of 0.5 g of manganese(IV) oxide speeds up this decomposition. Manganese(IV) oxide 

 is an insoluble solid. 

 The apparatus shown was used to follow the rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide was added to the conical flask and a stop‑watch was started.

**2** A student investigated the reaction between dilute hydrochloric acid and three different concentrations of aqueous sodium hydroxide, labelled **R** , **S** and **T**. 

 Three experiments were done. 

 Experiment 1 

 ● A burette was filled with dilute hydrochloric acid. The initial burette reading was measured. ● Using a measuring cylinder, 20 cm^3 of solution R was poured into a conical flask. ● Six drops of methyl orange indicator were added to the conical flask. ● Dilute hydrochloric acid was added from the burette, until the solution just changed colour. ● The final burette reading was measured.

**4** Potassium nitrate and ammonium chloride are two salts. The energy change when they each dissolve in water is endothermic. 

 Plan an experiment to show which of these two salts produces the larger endothermic energy change per gram. 

 Your answer should include: ● any measurements you would take and record ● how the results could be used to draw a conclusion. 

 You are provided with potassium nitrate and ammonium chloride, distilled water and common laboratory apparatus.
