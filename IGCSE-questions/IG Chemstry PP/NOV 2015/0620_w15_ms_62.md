## This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and candidates, to indicate the requirements ofthe examination. It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does notindicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began,which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal ExaminerReport for Teachers.Cambridge will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.Cambridge is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2015 series for most^ 0620/62^ Paper 6 (Alternative to Practical), maximum raw mark 60

 Answer^ 

 Marks^ Guidance 6 Method 1: Monitoring the reaction of the metal with acid^ 6 from:^ •^ named acid;^ •^ same or stated volume of (same concentration of) acid;^ •^ fair test idea, i.e. same surface area 

 /^ size^ /^ mass^ /^ amount metal; 

-^ measure volume of gas^ /^ count bubbles 

 /^ temperature change^ /^ observe complete reaction; • suitable reference to time; • conclusion^ /^ comparison, e.g. most effervescence = most reactive; Method 2: Displacement reaction 6 from: • react each metal; • with named acid; • to prepare salt solution of each; • react each metal with each solution of salt; • observe if displacement occurs; • conclusion^ /^ comparison; 

 6 I:^ use of heat unless this is identified as the outputvariable for the experiment
