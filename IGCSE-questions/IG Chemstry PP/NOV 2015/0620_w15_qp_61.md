**4** A student investigated the rate of reaction between magnesium ribbon and four different solutions of dilute sulfuric acid, **A** , **B** , **C** and **D**. The sulfuric acid was in excess in all experiments. 

 Four experiments were carried out. 

 (a) Experiment 1 

 Using a measuring cylinder, 30 cm 3 of aqueous sulfuric acid A was poured into a beaker. The stop clock was started and a 4 cm length of magnesium was added to the sulfuric acid in the beaker. The mixture was stirred constantly. The time taken for all of the magnesium to react and disappear was measured. The beaker was rinsed out with distilled water. 

 (b) Experiment 2 

 Experiment 1 was repeated using the solution B of sulfuric acid. 

 (c) Experiments 3 and 4 

 Experiment 1 was repeated, using the solutions C and D of sulfuric acid.

 (g) Why was the same amount of magnesium used in Experiments 1, 2, 3 and 4? 

 .............................................................................................................................................. [1] 

 (h) Another experiment was carried out. A 4 cm length of magnesium ribbon was added to dilute sulfuric acid. The temperature of the solution was measured before and after the reaction. The observations were recorded and the gas given off tested. 

 Observations: Rapid effervescence and the tube felt hot. A lighted splint popped. 

 Use the thermometer diagrams to record the temperatures.
