## General information about practical exams 

Centres must follow the guidance on science practical exams given in the _Cambridge Handbook_. 

### Safety 

Supervisors must follow national and local regulations relating to safety and first aid. 

Only those procedures described in the question paper should be attempted. 

Supervisors must inform candidates that materials and apparatus used in the exam should be treated with caution. Suitable eye protection should be used where necessary. 

The following hazard codes are used in these confidential instructions, where relevant: 

 C corrosive MH moderate hazard HH health hazard T acutely toxic F flammable O oxidising N hazardous to the aquatic environment 

Hazard data sheets relating to substances used in this exam should be available from your chemical supplier. 

### Before the exam 

● The packets containing the question papers must **not** be opened before the exam. ● It is assumed that standard school laboratory facilities, as indicated in the _Guide to Planning Practical Science_ , will be available. ● Spare materials and apparatus for the tasks set must be available for candidates, if required. 

### During the exam 

● It must be made clear to candidates at the start of the exam that they may request spare materials and apparatus for the tasks set. ● Where specified, the supervisor **must** perform the experiments and record the results as instructed. This must be done **out of sight** of the candidates, using the same materials and apparatus as the candidates. ● Any assistance provided to candidates must be recorded in the supervisor’s report. ● If any materials or apparatus need to be replaced, for example, in the event of breakage or loss, this must be recorded in the supervisor’s report. 

### After the exam 

● The supervisor must complete a report for each practical session held and each laboratory used. ● Each packet of scripts returned to Cambridge International must contain the following items: 

 ● the scripts of the candidates specified on the bar code label provided ● the supervisor’s results relevant to these candidates ● the supervisor’s reports relevant to these candidates ● seating plans for each practical session, referring to each candidate by candidate number ● the attendance register.
