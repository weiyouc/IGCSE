 (iii) From the chromatogram it is not possible to tell if the red ink contains different dyes. 

 Suggest how the experiment could be changed to find out if the red ink contains different dyes.

**2** A student investigated the reaction between dilute hydrochloric acid and two different aqueous solutions of sodium carbonate, solution **E** and solution **F**. 

 Three experiments were done. 

 (a) Experiment 1 ● A burette was filled up to the 0.0 cm^3 mark with dilute hydrochloric acid. ● Using a measuring cylinder, 25 cm^3 of solution E was poured into a conical flask. ● Five drops of thymolphthalein indicator were added to the conical flask. ● Dilute hydrochloric acid was slowly added from the burette to the conical flask, while the flask was swirled, until the solution just changed colour. 

 Use the burette diagrams to complete the table for Experiment 1.

 Experiment 2 ● The conical flask was emptied and rinsed with distilled water. ● The burette was refilled with dilute hydrochloric acid. ● Experiment 1 was repeated using five drops of methyl orange indicator instead of thymolphthalein indicator. 

 Use the burette diagrams to complete the table for Experiment 2.

 Experiment 3 ● The conical flask was emptied and rinsed with distilled water. ● The burette was refilled with dilute hydrochloric acid. ● Using a measuring cylinder, 25 cm^3 of solution F was poured into the conical flask. ● Five drops of methyl orange indicator were added to the conical flask. ● Dilute hydrochloric acid was slowly added from the burette to the conical flask, while the flask was swirled, until the solution just changed colour.

## 3 Two solids, solid G and solid H , were analysed. Solid G was copper(II) carbonate. 

 Tests were done on each solid. 

 tests on solid G 

 Complete the expected observations. 

 (a) Solid G was placed in a boiling tube. An excess of dilute sulfuric acid was added to the boiling tube. Any gas produced was tested.

 tests on solid H 

 Tests were done and the following observations were made. 

 tests on solid H observations 

 test 1 

 Flame test yellow flame 

 test 2 

 Some of solid H was placed in a boiling tube. The boiling tube was heated strongly. 

 condensation appeared near the mouth of the boiling tube 

 Solid H was dissolved in distilled water. The solution was divided into two equal portions. 

 test 3 

 About 1 cm^3 of dilute nitric acid followed by a few drops of aqueous silver nitrate were added to the first portion of the solution. 

 the solution remained colourless 

 test 4 

 About 1 cm 3 of dilute nitric acid followed by a few drops of aqueous barium nitrate were added to the second portion of the solution.

 4 Cobalt, manganese and nickel are metals. They react with dilute hydrochloric acid to form hydrogen gas. 

 Plan an investigation to find the order of reactivity of these three metals. 

 You are provided with: ● samples of each metal ● dilute hydrochloric acid ● common laboratory apparatus. 

 Your plan must make it clear how your investigation will be a fair test and how you will use your results to place the metals in order of reactivity.
