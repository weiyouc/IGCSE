**2** A student investigated the temperature change when magnesium ribbon reacts with dilute sulfuric acid. 

 Five experiments were done. 

 Experiment 1 ● Using a measuring cylinder, 20 cm^3 of dilute sulfuric acid were poured into a boiling tube. ● A thermometer was used to measure the initial temperature of the acid. ● A 1 cm length of magnesium ribbon was added to the acid in the boiling tube. ● The acid and magnesium ribbon in the boiling tube were stirred continuously using a thermometer. ● The highest temperature reached by the mixture was measured. ● The boiling tube was rinsed out with distilled water. 

 Experiment 2 ● Experiment 1 was repeated using a 2 cm length of magnesium ribbon instead of the 1 cm length. 

 Experiment 3 ● Experiment 1 was repeated using a 3 cm length of magnesium ribbon instead of the 1 cm length. 

 Experiment 4 ● Experiment 1 was repeated using a 5 cm length of magnesium ribbon instead of the 1 cm length. 

 Experiment 5 ● Experiment 1 was repeated using a 6 cm length of magnesium ribbon instead of the 1 cm length.

## 3 Two solids, solid L and solid M , were analysed. Solid L was chromium(III) chloride. 

 Tests were done on each solid. 

 tests on solid L 

 Complete the expected observations. 

 Solid L was dissolved in distilled water to produce solution L. Solution L was divided into four portions in three test-tubes and a boiling tube. 

 (a) To the first portion of solution L in the boiling tube, about 1 cm depth of dilute hydrochloric acid was added. The boiling tube was warmed gently. 

## A strip of filter paper was dipped in acidified potassium manganate(VII) solution and held at 

 the mouth of the boiling tube. 

 observations ........................................................................................................................ [1] 

 (b) To the second portion of solution L aqueous sodium hydroxide was added slowly until it was in excess and no further changes were seen.

 test 2 

 About 10 cm 3 of dilute nitric acid was added to solid M. Any gas produced was tested.

 test 3 

 About 1 cm depth of aqueous barium nitrate was added to the solution formed by adding dilute nitric acid to solid M in test 2.

**4** Many window-cleaning products contain aqueous ammonia. Aqueous ammonia is an alkali that reacts with dilute acids. 

 Plan an investigation to find which of two window-cleaning products contains the most concentrated aqueous ammonia. Include in your plan: ● the method you will use ● how your results will be used to determine which window-cleaning product contains the most concentrated aqueous ammonia. 

 You are provided with an aqueous solution of the two window-cleaning products, dilute hydrochloric acid of known concentration and common laboratory apparatus.
